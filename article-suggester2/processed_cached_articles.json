因此統率著這群精英的人物，絕對不可能會是什麼泛泛之輩。\n\n\n\n    「啊！各位同學，大家快看，是學生會的那兩位！」\n\n\n\n    一名少女發出興奮的尖叫，並將熱情的視線投向走來的兩人，頓時讓方才還一片寧靜的走廊騷動了起來。\n\n\n\n    成為眾人目光焦點的兩名少年男女，泰然自若地邁著腳步前進。\n\n\n\n    在一片交頭接耳的議論聲中，也不曉得是施了什麼樣的魔法，兩人的腳步聲反而顯得格外清晰響亮。\n\n\n\n    眼神犀利的男學生和清麗脫俗的女學生並肩同行的模樣，隱然有股龍行虎步的氣勢，也難怪眾人的目光都被兩人吸引過去。\n\n\n\n    將視線駐留在兩人身上的某名少女，甚至不由自主地發出讚歎之聲。\n\n\n\n    「啊，輝夜大人……您實在是太美麗了。」\n\n\n\n    百合、牡丹、芍藥……這名舉手投足皆能以花來比喻的美麗少女──\n\n\n\n    正是秀知院學園學生會副會長•四宮輝夜。\n\n\n\n    總資產高達兩百兆日圓，旗下坐擁上千家子公司的『四宮集團』，橫跨了鐵路、銀行、汽車等各種產業領域，位列四大財團之一。\n\n\n\n    作為本家總帥•四宮雁庵的長女，這名少女生來便是貨真價實的千金小姐。\n\n\n\n    彷彿是要證實自身的優秀血統一樣，她在才藝、音樂、武道等各種領域都創下了輝煌的成績，是個無庸置疑的『天才』。四宮輝夜就是這樣的人物。\n\n\n\n    而這位四宮輝夜所輔佐的男人就是──\n\n\n\n    「啊，會長的那個眼神……簡直像是能看穿世間一切的真相……」\n\n\n\n    秀知院學園學生會長•白銀禦行。\n\n\n\n    質樸剛毅、聰明睿智。校內模擬考的絕對王者。\n\n\n\n    即使是放眼全國，也足以和競逐頂點的其他天才一較長短，甚至是略勝一籌。\n\n\n\n    和多才多藝的輝夜正好相反，白銀純粹憑著勤學苦讀贏得了全校師生的敬畏，以其堪稱模範的行為獲選為學生會長，是個相當了不起的人物。\n\n\n\n    代代由學生會長傳承下來的純金飾繩，擁有秀知院學園兩百年曆史的重量。\n\n\n\n    光是在擦身而過時被白銀瞥上一眼，就足以令女學生感受到冰冷徹骨的寒意。但這也只能說是沒有辦法的事情。\n\n\n\n    在學生能從小學部一路直升至大學部的秀知院學園裡，中途轉學進來的『混院』學生就任學生會長，可謂相當罕見的情形。縱觀學園的漫長歷史，也只能找到三個案例。\n\n\n\n    而且白銀還在今年秋天的選舉之中，二度蟬聯學生會長的寶座，堪稱特例中的特例。\n\n\n\n    面對那雙目光如電的眼睛，秀知院學園的普通學生幾乎都產生了一種共識：那些敢和白銀正眼相對的人，要么不是性格無比堅強，要么就是為人清廉潔白、從而絲毫無懼他人非議。\n\n\n\n    「大家快看啊，輝夜大人和會長談得有說有笑的呢……」\n\n\n\n    「哎，輝夜大人難道一點都不會害怕會長嗎？」\n\n\n\n    「輝夜大人當然不會害怕啊。畢竟她肯定從來沒有做過任何虧心事。有資格和會長並肩站在一起的，也就只有像輝夜大人這樣的淑女了。」\n\n\n\n    「他們兩位是不是正在交往呢？」\n\n\n\n    「不曉得呢。不過這麼說起來，在這次選舉的不久之前，的確是有傳聞指出會長向輝夜大人告白了呢──」\n\n\n\n    在學園這樣的封閉環境裡，這類八卦話題永遠不會過時。\n\n\n\n    更何況這是君臨於秀知院頂點的兩名天才的戀愛故事，其他學生自然是對此感到興致勃勃。\n\n\n\n    然而，這兩人的實際關係是──\n\n\n\n    ♂♂♂\n\n\n\n    「雖說選舉才剛結束不久，但是大家對這個話題還真是聊不膩吶。」\n\n\n\n    在走向學生會辦公室的路上，白銀禦行向身旁的少女如此搭話道。\n\n\n\n    可是，白銀的視線卻沒有從手上移開。他手裡拿著的是法文的單字本。要求自己一天讀書十小時的白銀，即使是零碎的移動時間也不打算白白浪費。\n\n\n\n    在這個走路玩手機會被師長警告的時代，走路讀書的行為基本上早已絕跡，白銀的這副用功模樣，簡直就是※二宮金次郎的現代化身。（譯註：二宮金次郎是江戶時代的思想家，以勤學苦讀而著稱於世，昭和時代的日本小學大量設置了他的銅像，造型為背柴苦讀的童子。）\n\n\n\n    面對這樣的白銀，少女不禁苦笑了起來，但是並沒有打算責備對方的不禮貌，因為她早就習已為常了。\n\n\n\n    「這種年紀會對戀愛話題感興趣是當然的，一笑置之就好了吧。」\n\n\n\n    兩人以沉著的語調進行著對話。那副好整以暇的態度，宛如是在嘲笑其他學生的愚蠢，絲毫藏不住內心的愛情煩惱。\n\n\n\n    「嗯？」\n\n\n\n    白銀從單字本上抬起視線，發現四宮輝夜將手摀在嘴邊，露出一個優雅的微笑。\n\n\n\n    輝夜方才所說的那番話，白銀依稀記得自己也曾經說過。\n\n\n\n    雖然已經想不起來龍去脈，但是他記得兩人之前有過同樣的對話。對記憶力頗有自信的白銀，很確定先前有過這樣的事情。\n\n\n\n    「這樣子啊？說得也是呢。」\n\n\n\n    如果沒記錯的話，那應該是八個月前的事情。\n\n\n\n    兩人就像剛才那樣，走在學園的走廊上，隱約聽到了周圍的交頭接耳聲。\n\n\n\n    「難道他們兩人有在交往嗎？」\n\n\n\n    聽到這句話後，白銀是這麼想的：\n\n\n\n    （哼，說我跟四宮在交往？居然熱烈地討論這種無聊的戀愛話題，真是一群蠢蛋。）\n\n\n\n    沒錯，這正是合乎統率整座學園的學生會長的意見。\n\n\n\n    （……嗯，不過嘛。）\n\n\n\n    （如果四宮說無論如何都想跟我交往的話，那要我考慮一下也是可以的啦！）\n\n\n\n    非常遺憾的是，白銀禦行終究也是個高中男生。\n\n\n\n    他會下意識地對擁有戀人的朋友感到自卑；也會徜徉在學弟每週帶來的漫畫雜誌的愛情喜劇之中；甚至還會順便翻看那些有點色情的漫畫。\n\n\n\n    但是，他在日常生活的言行舉止裡，會極力避免給人留下這種思春期少年的印象，白銀禦行就是這樣的男人。\n\n\n\n    （畢竟她對我一定有意思，向我告白只是早晚的問題吧……）\n\n\n\n    白銀摩挲著下巴笑了起來，彷彿獵人一樣，露出將獵物逼至絕境的銳利眼神。\n\n\n\n    （呵呵，快點卸下你那完美大小姐的面具，羞紅著臉跑來向我哀求吧。）\n\n\n\n    白銀的腦海之中，浮現出頰染紅暈的輝夜向自己告白的模樣，忍不住暗自竊笑了起來。\n\n\n\n    ♀♀♀\n\n\n\n    另一方面，完全不曉得白銀在思索這些事情的輝夜，在搖擺著優雅的及膝長裙前行的同時，也在心中打著自己的小算盤。\n\n\n\n    （真是的……庸俗的愚民們。你們到底是把本小姐當成什麼人啦？我可是身為國家核心的四宮家族的一員耶！居然異想天開地以為我會跟平民交往？）\n\n\n\n    她保持著臉上若無其事的微笑，對於周圍人的誤解忍不住嘆了口氣。\n\n\n\n    雖然常言有云：「溫柔穩重的女性，總是走在男人身後三步之處」，但是將自己的背後暴露給這個女人，實在不是什麼明智之舉。\n\n\n\n    和純白無瑕的外表恰好相反，輝夜的內心是黑色……不對，應該說是宛如乾涸血跡般的鐵黑色。\n\n\n\n    （哎呀，雖然會長的確是有著非常非常非常勉強過關的可能性啦！如果他願意跪下來獻上他的身心、甚至是故鄉的話，要我來把他調教成一個配得上本小姐的男人也不是不行啦……）\n\n\n\n    輝夜的腦海之中，浮現出白銀帶著精悍銳利的眼神向自己訴說衷情的模樣。忍不住就要苦笑起來的她，硬是把臉上的表情壓了下去。\n\n\n\n    若是用一句話來概括表述的話。\n\n\n\n    ──只要白銀主動告白，她說不定就會答應交往。\n\n\n\n    （畢竟這個天底下根本就不存在不會迷上本小姐的男人啊！只是早晚的問題吧？）\n\n\n\n    只聽輝夜發出一陣輕笑，嘴角漾起一抹她這個年齡的少女獨有的戀愛笑容。\n\n\n\n    白銀和輝夜之間的關係，說是兩情相悅也不為過。\n\n\n\n    只要有其中一方做出愛的告白，這段戀情便會開花結果。幸福美滿的結局就在伸手可及之處。\n\n\n\n    而且他們兩人也都察覺到了這一點。\n\n\n\n    只是時間的問題而已。\n\n\n\n    沒錯，對方肯定早晚會向自己告白。\n\n\n\n    自己無需著急，只要守株待兔就可以了──\n\n\n\n    結果他們這樣想著想著，八個月的時間就過去了。\n\n\n\n    在這段時間裡，並沒有發生任何特別的──不，也不能說是完全沒有發生什麼事情。兩人同乘一輛腳踏車上學、共撐一把雨傘回家、和大家一起去看煙火、在第二次的學生會選舉中獲得連任、在美術課上互相畫對方的肖像畫，甚至還詢問了內褲的顏色──仔細一想就會發現，他們兩人之間其實發生了許多事情！\n\n\n\n    然而，就是沒有人主動告白！\n\n\n\n    沒錯，問題就出在兩人都是異性眼中的萬人迷。\n\n\n\n    就算自己不主動出擊，其他人也會自動喜歡上自己、自動跑來向自己告白──這就是白銀和輝夜的戀愛觀。\n\n\n\n    不管兩人多麼想要心意相通、多麼渴求彼此的存在，如果他們都選擇等待對方的主動告白，事情當然不會有任何進展。在最壞的情況下，兩人可能終其一生都是現在這樣的關係。\n\n\n\n    其結果就是，等待對方告白的兩人，在這件事上鑽起了牛角尖，已經從『要交往也可以』，轉變為『要怎麼讓對方主動告白』了。\n\n\n\n    最近這陣子，甚至演變到了『算我求你了，趕快向我告白吧！』的地步，但是戳破這一點未免也太不知趣了。\n\n\n\n    各懷鬼胎的兩人，今天也一樣在前往學生會辦公室的路上，在心中盤算著如何讓對方主動告白的策略。\n\n\n\n    ♂♂♂\n\n\n\n    白銀和輝夜在踏進學生會辦公室後，發現裡頭已經有人先到了。\n\n\n\n    「啊，會長，還有四宮學姊……你們來啦。」\n\n\n\n    淺坐在沙發上的這位男學生，名字是石上優。\n\n\n\n    他在學生會中是擔任會計一職，是個處理資料的行家。\n\n\n\n    秀知院學園的製度規定，只有會長是透過選舉進行選拔，其他成員則按照能力由會長進行任命。石上在前一屆的學生會中，儘管只是剛入學不久的一年級學生，卻是白銀親自邀請他加入學生會的優秀人材。他在本屆的學生會中，當然也繼續擔任著會計一職。\n\n\n\n    石上遮住半邊眼睛的長長前發，以及片刻不離身的頭戴式耳機，給人一種極力避免和他人發生接觸的印象。事實上，他在加入學生會之後，也的確有好一陣子的時間，都是把工作帶回家中處理。\n\n\n\n    但即使是這樣的石上，也開始出現了顯著的成長。他最近已經會和其他成員一樣，待在學生會室里處理作業；和白銀他們待在一起的時候，也會主動摘下耳機；甚至為了改變自己而加入了應援團。\n\n\n\n    相較於白銀和輝夜停滯不前的關係，石上可說是取得了長足的進步。\n\n\n\n    「咦？石上，只有你到了而已啊？」\n\n\n\n    白銀和輝夜在過來之前，先去參加了社團聯合會議，因此他一直以為其他成員早就已經到齊了。\n\n\n\n    撇除石上不說，學生會還有兩名幹部。因為這兩人除了學生會以外，還參加了其他社團和委員會，所以白銀想說她們是不是在忙另一邊的事情。然而，石上卻搖了搖頭，否定了白銀的猜想。\n\n\n\n    「不是，其實藤原學姊和伊井野都已經來過了，只是她們在看到這個東西之後，就飛也似地跑了出去……」\n\n\n\n    石上說著說著，畏畏縮縮地把一個白色信封遞了過來。\n\n\n\n    「這是什麼？給學生會的建議書嗎？」\n\n\n\n    「……請你先讀讀裡面的內容。」\n\n\n\n    在這個時間點上，白銀已經有股不祥的預感。\n\n\n\n    是事件的味道。\n\n\n\n    石上是個優秀的人材。如果這封信是和工作相關的通知，他應該會簡單扼要地說明內容，不會勞煩事務繁忙的白銀親自過目。石上既然沒有選擇這麼做，而是請白銀直接閱讀信件的內容，就代表著他無法獨自做出判斷。\n\n\n\n    白銀做好面對麻煩的心理準備，打開了裝在信封裡的信紙。\n\n\n\n    『你為什麼不肯回覆我呢？我很清楚你是一個孤高的存在。我對你的理解就是如此透澈，甚至可以說只有我能夠理解你的存在。你是如此的美麗。為了準備體育祭而在操場上奔跑的你，就連滴落的汗水都是那樣地美麗。啊，我多麼希望能將你的美麗永恆不變地保存下來。屆時的我，也將伴隨著你一起邁入永恆吧。我們兩人將一起化為永恆，而你的美麗也會由此保留下來。這明明是比什麼都來得重要的事情──但是你為什麼不願意接受我的這份心意？難道你無法理解我的想法嗎？如果你還是像現在這樣，始終不給我任何回覆，我將親自動手將你化為永恆。雖然這樣子做可能會違反你的意志，但是將你的美麗永遠保存下來這件事情，肯定是連神明也會認可的正確行為吧。』\n\n\n\n    「……唔。」\n\n\n\n    閱讀完信件內容的白銀，慎重地將信紙折起放回信封。\n\n\n\n    因為輝夜恰好在此時端了紅茶過來，所以白銀在接過茶杯之後，順手把信封遞給了她。輝夜在交換紅茶和信封的時候，若無其事地向白銀詢問道：\n\n\n\n    「裡面寫了什麼內容？」\n\n\n\n    「沒什麼，只是一封普通的恐嚇信而已。」\n\n\n\n    白銀泰然自若地回答道，同時啜了一口紅茶。\n\n\n\n    在旁人眼中看來，他的這副模樣就像是不為小事所動搖的英雄豪傑。\n\n\n\n    任何時候都保持著冷靜沉著。儘管白銀臉上的鎮定表情沒有破功，然而……\n\n\n\n    （太恐怖了！欸……這是什麼鬼啊……居然說「我將親自動手將你化為永恆」，這已經是需要報警的程度了吧？不行不行，這已經超出學生會能夠應對的範圍了！這也太恐怖了吧，不要鬧了啊！）\n\n\n\n    他的內心其實一點都不冷靜，而是嚇得心驚膽跳。\n\n\n\n    臉上頓失血色的白銀，連眼眸也變得黯淡無光，只能拚命掩飾自己顫抖的手。為了避免手上的紅茶從杯子裡潑灑出來，白銀一口飲盡了整杯紅茶，嘴裡登時湧現一陣燒灼的疼痛感。\n\n\n\n    不過，這股刺痛的感覺，反而讓險些屈服於恐懼的白銀重新振作了起來。\n\n\n\n    白銀先是輕咳了幾下，確認喉嚨沒問題之後，開口向石上詢問道：\n\n\n\n    「話說回來，以一封恐嚇信來說，犯人做事也未免太過馬虎了吧……這不是連收件人都忘記寫上了嗎？這封信裡的『你』到底是在指誰啊？」\n\n\n\n    「嗯，因此在這個問題上，藤原學姊和伊井野她們……」\n\n\n\n    「啊，我想那個──」\n\n\n\n    就在石上及不知為何讀起信來的輝夜正要開口答話時，兩人的聲音被一道猛烈的開門聲給打斷了。\n\n\n\n    「即使是醫生也束手無策的戀愛病，同樣可以保證藥到病除的名偵探！戀愛偵探千花來也！」\n\n\n\n    氣喘吁籲地衝進學生會辦公室的人，正是擔任學生會書記一職的藤原千花。\n\n\n\n    而她戴在頭上的那頂獵鹿帽，是從演劇社借來的慣用行頭。基於某種旁人無從知曉的堅持，每當提及戀愛的相關話題時，藤原幾乎一定都會出動這頂獵鹿帽。\n\n\n\n    儘管學生會本身就已經人手不足，藤原和輝夜卻偶爾還會被演劇社拉去幫忙。不過因為她們兩人看起來都樂在其中，自己也能趁機欣賞到輝夜罕見的COSPLAY打扮，所以白銀倒也沒有太多怨言就是了。\n\n\n\n    畢竟藤原的行動實在有太多槽點，真要吐槽起來只會陷入沒完沒了的泥淖──然而，今天的白銀終於忍不住將疑問宣之於口。\n\n\n\n    「哎？你為什麼會換上這副打扮？這次的事情應該和戀愛無關吧？」\n\n\n\n    「嘖嘖嘖～你看得太淺啦，※華行。」（譯註：福爾摩斯的助手華生的諧音。 ）\n\n\n\n    藤原一臉得意地搖著手指說道。誰是華行啊！不要隨便把助手的角色安到別人頭上！──面對準備如此出聲抗議的白銀，藤原倏地用食指指著他說道：\n\n\n\n    「在御子同學的眼中看來，這封信是一封恐嚇信，但是戀愛偵探的法眼可沒有那麼容易糊弄！本偵探認為，這是一封在向某位女性傾吐苦戀之情的情書。雖然感覺有那麼一點危險就是了。」\n\n\n\n    「不是吧？不管怎麼看，這都是一封恐嚇信吧？」\n\n\n\n    白銀理所當然地吐槽了這麼一句，可是石上有些顧慮地接著開口說道：\n\n\n\n    「哎，雖然乍看之下確實帶有恐嚇的味道，但是我也認為……這的確可以算是一封情書。因此儘管很不甘心，不過我也贊同藤原學姊的意見。可是伊井野堅持這是一封恐嚇信，所以現在分成了兩派意見。」\n\n\n\n    白銀感到恍然大悟。石上剛才之所以未作任何說明，只是要求白銀先讀完內容再說，就是為了避免他的判斷受到先入為主的資訊影響。\n\n\n\n    「原來如此，確實也是可以從這個角度來解讀。」\n\n\n\n    「嘿嘿！戀愛偵探永遠都能看穿事件的真相！」\n\n\n\n    接受了這個論點的白銀，撤回了自己的主張。雖然他根本沒把藤原的意見放在心上，但是既然石上都這麼說了，這封信是情書的可能性就相當高。石上的敏銳洞察力是白銀自嘆弗如的，因此他不會傲慢到毫無根據地否定石上的意見。\n\n\n\n    「啊？不過，藤原書記，你剛才是說『向某位女性傾吐苦戀之情的情書』對吧？你怎麼知道是向某位女性？在這封信的內容裡，完全沒有提到『你』是什麼人啊。」\n\n\n\n    「嘿嘿，這是因為啊……因為……………………咦？」\n\n\n\n    藤原突然歪起腦袋。\n\n\n\n    「這麼說起來，我為什麼會覺得這是一封男性寫給女性的情書啊？雖然筆跡看起來的確像是出自男生之手，但是光只有這樣子應該不足以成為鐵證──咦？」\n\n\n\n    戀愛偵探以手抵額，就此陷入了沉思之中。\n\n\n\n    看到她這副模樣，輝夜微微舉起了手來。\n\n\n\n    「藤原同學，關於這件事情──」\n\n\n\n    「不好意思！有沒有人能來幫我開個門？」\n\n\n\n    因為離門最近的戀愛傻瓜完全沉浸在思索之中，所以白銀只好無可奈何地起身走去開門，出現在門後的是伊井野禦子。\n\n\n\n    只見身材嬌小的她，抱著一個顯然相當沉重的紙箱，連她額頭都浮現出了汗珠。\n\n\n\n    白銀感到相當納悶，今天應該沒有預定要搬運如此沉重的東西過來。\n\n\n\n    「怎麼回事？這是什麼玩意兒？」\n\n\n\n    「這是要用來做筆跡鑑定的資料。為了鎖定恐嚇信的寄件人，我從實行委員那裡借來了體育祭的事前調查問卷。如此一來，就能和全校學生的筆跡進行比對了。」\n\n\n\n    「喂喂餵……那你先跟我或石上說一聲不就好了嗎？體育祭實行委員會離學生會辦公室這麼遠，你搬這些東西過來也太辛苦了吧？」\n\n\n\n    「那可不行，畢竟只有我的意見不同於其他人──唉，真是的。石上也就算了，居然連藤原學姊都認為這是一封情書……明明不管怎麼看，這都是一封恐嚇信啊！」\n\n\n\n    伊井野以一本正經的語調，不容分說地如此宣佈道，不過她說得有點上氣不接下氣。對於沒有什麼體力的伊井野來說，把全校學生的問卷調查結果搬來這裡，是無庸置疑的重度體力勞動。\n\n\n\n    然而，為了貫徹自己的信念，她可以無怨無悔地完成這些工作，伊井野禦子就是這樣的少女。先前曾經和白銀共同競逐會長寶座的她，如今在學生會中擔任會計監查一職，成為和白銀共事的同僚。\n\n\n\n    「你的意思是要比對所有問卷的筆跡來找出犯人？就算是學生會的所有人分工合作，這也得花上好幾天的功夫吧……」\n\n\n\n    「不，我會一個人完成這項工作。筆跡鑑定原本不是外行人應付得來的工作，但幸運的是，這封信的寄件人筆跡具有顯著的特徵。就拿這個『跑』字來說，對方幾乎是直接用一筆寫完，只要和體育祭的調查問捲進行比對，應該就有很大的機率可以鎖定犯人。請你放心，我不會因此懈怠學生會或風紀委員的工作的。」\n\n\n\n    伊井野斬釘截鐵地說道。在她充滿決心的眼眸裡，感受不到任何對於繁重作業的厭惡之情。伊井野是真的打算靠自己的力量揪出犯人。然而，彷彿是要對乾勁十足的她潑冷水──\n\n\n\n    「那個──」\n\n\n\n    輝夜以相當稀奇的猶豫語調插嘴說道：\n\n\n\n    「這封信肯定是寄給我的；我也知道寫下這封信的人是誰。」\n\n\n\n    「咦？」\n\n\n\n    「什麼？」\n\n\n\n    看著目瞪口呆的白銀和伊井野，輝夜露出有些難以啟齒的表情，但還是繼續說明了下去：\n\n\n\n    「就是啊，我有一次收到情書之後，不是和會長及藤原同學商量過這件事情嗎？這封信也是同一個人寫的。」\n\n\n\n    「……啊，的確是有這麼一回事呢。」\n\n\n\n    白銀回想起當時的事情。這件事情發生在暑假之前，表示自己收到情書的輝夜，甚至揚言自己要去和對方約會。在一番折騰之後，最後是藤原的淚水攻勢阻止了輝夜的赴約。\n\n\n\n    因為輝夜從此再也沒有提起這個話題，所以白銀原以為這件事情早就已經落幕了──\n\n\n\n    「哎──！」\n\n\n\n    一道尖銳的聲音，打斷了白銀的思考。\n\n\n\n    「那筆跡鑑定的事呢？人家好不容易才搬過來的耶！！」\n\n\n\n    面對調查問卷堆成的小山，伊井野的叫苦聲迴盪在整間學生會辦公室裡。\n\n\n\n    ♂♂♂\n\n\n\n    結果，最後是石上幫忙把調查問卷送了回去。\n\n\n\n    石上抓住心力交瘁的伊井野前往洗手間的空檔，主動站起身來說要把調查問卷送回去。他甚至沒給白銀幫忙的機會，就這樣快手快腳地獨自離開現場。石上其實對伊井野很好。伊井野若是能夠察覺到石上的善意，兩人的關係或許也有可能出現改善。\n\n\n\n    在石上離席不久之後，伊井野回到了學生會辦公室。這裡說句題外話，伊井野禦子很常跑洗手間。作為伊井野好友的大佛小缽，曾經如此評論道：「神明在把禦子打造得身形嬌小的同時，也細心地將她的膀胱尺寸做得很小」；石上則是下了這樣的註解•「她早晚有一天會尿在褲子上」。\n\n\n\n    因為好不容易搬過來的調查問卷沒能派上用場，所以伊井野整個人都消沉了下去，甚至沒發現那堆問卷小山已經消失無踪。\n\n\n\n    白銀不曉得該怎麼安慰沮喪的伊井野，只能刻意地清了清喉嚨，繼續把話題說了下去：\n\n\n\n    「所以，把四宮的話綜合起來說就是──暑假之前，收到情書的四宮在和我們商量之後，就已經直接向對方明確表示自己不會跟他交往。但是最近這一陣子又開始收到了情書。」\n\n\n\n    「嗯，對方先前都是把情書放到我的鞋櫃裡，可是我最近都沒有拆閱就直接扔掉。所以他才會改變方針，直接投遞到學生會辦公室來吧。」\n\n\n\n    這可真是令人困擾呢──四宮如此說道，臉上的表情卻完全沒有困擾的感覺。\n\n\n\n    「唔。」\n\n\n\n    的確是很令人困擾呢──白銀點頭說道，臉上完全沒有露出感到困擾的表情。\n\n\n\n    但是他此刻的內心想法和表現出來的態度，根本是差了十萬八千里。\n\n\n\n    （太恐怖了！光是這樣頻繁地投遞情書過來，感覺就已經夠不妙了，為什麼四宮還能保持一副平心靜氣的模樣啊？她是有信心在對方出手加害的時候，反過來製服住對方是嗎！？）\n\n\n\n    曾經親身被輝夜摔飛出去的白銀，拚命地掩飾著自己內心的動搖。\n\n\n\n    輝夜一邊幫這樣的白銀添上新的紅茶，一邊若無其事地開口說道：\n\n\n\n    「不過，這下子該怎麼辦才好呢？事情發展到這種地步，可能得借助其他人的力量才能解決了。可是對方一樣是我們學校的學生，去找老師或警察商量感覺又有那麼一點不妥──」\n\n\n\n    「嗯……」\n\n\n\n    白銀在輝夜的這番話裡，察覺到了微妙的語氣變化，不禁繃緊了神經。\n\n\n\n    慣例的頭腦戰來了──白銀的腦袋開始高速運轉起來。\n\n\n\n    「人家已經向對方清楚表達了他的行為令我很困擾，但是他依舊不肯善罷甘休。若是要讓這樣的人改變心意，可能要有一個更具說服力的理由才行。」\n\n\n\n    雖然輝夜的語氣像是在徵詢意見，但是她卻露出一道令人發寒的笑容，斜眼瞥了白銀一眼。\n\n\n\n    「有沒有人能夠直截了當地勸退對方呢？」\n\n\n\n    「唔。」\n\n\n\n    白銀一邊將盛著紅茶的茶杯送往嘴邊，一邊不動聲色地掃視周圍一圈。\n\n\n\n    石上目前不在房間裡；伊井野仍處於消沉狀態；藤原則是完全靠不住。\n\n\n\n    儘管輝夜用了「有沒有人」這種模棱兩可的說法，可是白銀已經察覺到只有自己能勝任這項任務。\n\n\n\n    白銀試著在腦海中想像自己勸退寄信人的光景。\n\n\n\n    ♂♂♂\n\n\n\n    就假設寄信人的名字是「Mr. X」吧。\n\n\n\n    在寒風凜冽的屋頂上，白銀和「Mr. X」相對而立。\n\n\n\n    白銀舉起白色的信封，向對方質問道：\n\n\n\n    「這封信是你寫的沒錯吧？你這樣子不斷地寫信給四宮，可是讓她感到非常困擾啊。不好意思，麻煩你以後別再做這種事情了。」\n\n\n\n    「這件事情和你沒關係吧！」神色出現動搖的「Mr. X」如此大叫道。\n\n\n\n    「哼，『沒關係』，是嗎？但是，我是學生會長，而四宮是副會長。同為學生會的成員，我認為我有資格介入這件事情。」\n\n\n\n    「戀愛是個人的自由！」 「Mr. X」怒吼出聲，臉上露出隨時都可能揮拳揍人的表情。\n\n\n\n    白銀嘆了口氣。戀愛是個人的自由。身為學生會長的自己有義務幫助副會長──看來這樣的理由完全無法勸退「Mr. X」。\n\n\n\n    既然如此，白銀只能選擇這麼回答：\n\n\n\n    「你想要理由的話，我可以告訴你。」\n\n\n\n    白銀一邊用手攏起被風吹亂的瀏海，一邊霸氣十足地宣佈道，彷彿有玫瑰花瓣在他身後飛舞一般。\n\n\n\n    「四宮是我的女人。」\n\n\n\n    聽到白銀這句斬釘截鐵的宣言，「Mr. X」只能絕望地癱倒在地上。\n\n\n\n    事情就這樣得到了解決。\n\n\n\n    輝夜從此擺脫了跟踪狂般的情書轟炸，並且和白銀正式展開交往──\n\n\n\n    （不不不，這樣子可不行啊！這樣子很不妙啊！）\n\n\n\n    白銀用力搖著腦袋，否定自己腦海中的想像。\n\n\n\n    ──「我的女人」宣言（My Love.CO）！\n\n\n\n    在古今中外的愛情故事裡，這都是最經典的必殺台詞。\n\n\n\n    從男方的角度來看，這是一種向周圍人宣示某位女性是自己戀人的行為；從女方的角度來看，這樣的宣言不僅解決了糾纏不休的男性，同時還能和曖昧不明的男性正式確立關係，可說是一石二鳥的發言。\n\n\n\n    沒錯，「我的女人」宣言，明顯是女性一方能獲得更大的收益。\n\n\n\n    在戀愛關係中，「先喜歡上對方的人是輸家」，可說是絕對的鐵則。也就是先告白的人會成為輸家。對於自尊心甚高的白銀和輝夜來說，要他們主動告白根本是不可能的事情。\n\n\n\n    假如白銀真的對輝夜做出了「我的女人」宣言──\n\n\n\n    『哎呀，會長也真是的，你就這麼想要獨占人家嗎……這還真是可愛呢。』\n\n\n\n    輝夜肯定會向他這麼說道。\n\n\n\n    「我的女人」宣言等同於主動告白──不對，若是把向周圍人宣示這一點也考慮進去，這是比告白更加激進的行為。對白銀來說，這是絕對必須避免的行動！\n\n\n\n    「咳咳咳──嗯！」\n\n\n\n    從想像世界中歸來的白銀，相當刻意地咳了好幾聲，試圖藉此轉換思緒。\n\n\n\n    雖說只是在想像的世界中，但宣稱輝夜是「我的女人」一事，還是讓白銀的臉頰微微紅了起來。\n\n\n\n    即使撇除女性一方能獲得更大的收益不說，白銀也重新認識到自己沒膽子宣稱輝夜是「我的女人」。\n\n\n\n    自己若是有勇氣做出如此丟臉的行為，就不會拖到今天都還沒有告白了。\n\n\n\n    「咳咳、咳咳！呃哎！」\n\n\n\n    「會長，你感冒了是嗎？」\n\n\n\n    「沒、沒事，什麼事也沒有。不好意思，你不用在意我。」\n\n\n\n    藤原一臉擔心地窺探著白銀的臉孔，白銀見狀把臉別了過去，同時伸手撫摩著喉嚨。\n\n\n\n    白銀只要想到那些丟臉的舉動，或者回想起過去的失敗經驗，便會不由自主地想要在地上翻滾吼叫。\n\n\n\n    然而，這裡並不是自己的房間。身為學生會長的白銀，沒有辦法在校內做出這樣的行為。\n\n\n\n    作為補償行為，白銀持續乾咳了好半晌的時間，直到心情徹底平復下來。\n\n\n\n    ♀♀♀\n\n\n\n    另一方面，就在白銀拚命隱藏那股折磨人的羞恥感的同時，輝夜其實也沉浸在同樣的想像之中。\n\n\n\n    （會長的「我的女人」宣言（My Love.CO）──）\n\n\n\n    輝夜試著在腦海中描繪，白銀為了自己和寄信人直接展開談判的光景。而在白銀做出「輝夜是我的女人」的宣言之後，兩人就此正式確立戀人關係。\n\n\n\n    為了掩飾自己的表情，輝夜端起茶杯送到嘴邊。\n\n\n\n    （呵呵，會長也真是的，居然說什麼「我的女人」，把人家說得像是他的所有物一樣──真是的！這人怎麼這麼壞啊！真是太不像話了！）\n\n\n\n    當她把茶杯擱回茶碟的時候，臉上的表情已經變得和先前截然不同，洋溢著藏也藏不住的喜悅。\n\n\n\n    輝夜完全沒有意識到，當她在腦海中描繪自己和白銀的關係進展時，整個人會酥軟地擺動起身體。\n\n\n\n    若是從小就和輝夜一起生活的專屬侍女──早坂愛也在現場的話，肯定會傻眼到不知道該說什麼才好吧。\n\n\n\n    早坂非常清楚輝夜絕對不在學生會成員面前展露的那張面孔，因此主人此刻這副茫酥酥的模樣，在她眼中看來或許就像是頭頂長出了一朵花。\n\n\n\n    如果說平常凜凜生威的輝夜，是一幅堪比照片的精細畫作，那麼此刻的輝夜就是小孩子用蠟筆劃出來的塗鴉。兩者的差異就是如此地判若兩人。\n\n\n\n    擁有優秀洞察力的石上優，若是有留在學生會辦公室裡，在看到輝夜的表情變化之後，很可能會推測紅茶裡頭添加了某種違法藥物。四宮學姊通過非法手段讓自己「嗨」起來──做出如此猜想的石上，肯定會害怕得全身哆嗦不已。\n\n\n\n    然而，早坂和石上都不在現場。\n\n\n\n    藤原一直沉浸在自己的思緒之中，伊井野則是依舊一蹶不振，白銀為了趕跑腦內的妄想，正在不停地假咳。因此輝夜很幸運地沒被任何人注意到自己的醜態。\n\n\n\n    而將輝夜從腦海中的花田拉回現實的，是白銀的一陣陣乾咳聲。\n\n\n\n    「咳咳、咳咳！呃哎！」\n\n\n\n    「會長，你感冒了是嗎？」\n\n\n\n    「沒、沒事，什麼事也沒有。不好意思，你不用在意我。」\n\n\n\n    雖然白銀用話語做出了否定，但是輝夜的腦海中浮現了某個畫面。\n\n\n\n    那是幾分鐘前的事情。白銀在把信封遞給輝夜和將紅茶湊到嘴邊啜飲的時候，輝夜都有註意到他在全身發抖。\n\n\n\n    再加上白銀從剛才開始，就一直很不自然地咳嗽。\n\n\n\n    全身發抖加上咳嗽不已──能由此推導出來的結論只有一個。\n\n\n\n    （絕對沒錯。會長肯定是感冒了！這可不行！我得趕緊帶他去保健室才行。畢竟我之前感冒的時候，也有受到會長的照顧。）\n\n\n\n    輝夜回想起了暑假前的那件事情。白銀在那一天首次造訪了輝夜所居住的四宮家別墅。雖說那次的探病事件引發了些許風波，但是輝夜認為這是兩碼子事。\n\n\n\n    （在會長入睡以前，我得陪伴在他身旁才行呢。如果他遲遲無法入睡，我就來講個故事給他聽吧。呵呵，會長也真是的，簡直像是個小朋友似的。不過這也是沒辦法的事情呢。畢竟任何人在感冒的時候，都會出現些許心智年齡退化的現象嘛。）\n\n\n\n    輝夜在心中如此思忖道，也不曉得她知不知道自己在生病時會變得像小朋友一樣。\n\n\n\n    受人點滴之恩，定當湧泉以報──就在下定決心的輝夜準備開口的時候，她突然停下了自己的動作。\n\n\n\n    （等一下。剛才藤原同學詢問會長是否感冒時，他直接做出了否認。換句話說，會長是想要隱瞞自己生病的事實？）\n\n\n\n    白銀禦行是個責任感極強的男人。與其讓別人分擔自己的工作，他顯然會選擇強忍身體的不適繼續工作下去。\n\n\n\n    即使輝夜表示要帶白銀去保健室，白銀恐怕也會謝絕她的好意。\n\n\n\n    但是，輝夜必須帶白銀去保健室，並且在旁邊照顧他才行。\n\n\n\n    沒錯，這是最基本的為人之道。\n\n\n\n    （受人點滴之恩，定當湧泉以報；若有患病之人，應於其旁照護。這可是做人的基本道德！就算是小學生也懂得這種道理！幫會長熬粥並且伺候他吃下去；用濕毛巾幫他擦拭身體；有需要的話，甚至可以在旁邊陪著他入睡……人家可沒有在亂想這些事情！雖然如果有必要的話，我也是會選擇這麼做啦！）\n\n\n\n    然而，這裡有一個需要克服的巨大難關。\n\n\n\n    照顧病人這件事情，必須取得雙方當事人的同意。\n\n\n\n    假如輝夜強行拖著不願意的白銀前去保健室，並且無視他本人的意志開始照顧他的身體，那麼這幅光景會給人一種似曾相識之感。\n\n\n\n    簡直像是主動送上門來的老婆，不僅強行闖進男方家裡，還擅自幫忙做起家事來！\n\n\n\n    （如果是這樣的話，強行把男生帶到保健室去，並且擅自照顧起對方身體的女人……）\n\n\n\n    不是主動送上門來的老婆，而是霸王硬上弓的老婆！\n\n\n\n    （……話說人家才不是他老婆！）\n\n\n\n    在甩開腦中的煩惱之後，輝夜總算意識到了其中的危機。\n\n\n\n    不同於先前充滿粉紅泡泡的幻想，輝夜的思路變得敏銳清晰了起來。與此同時，她也意識到自己方才不小心陷入了思維的迷宮。\n\n\n\n    （根據我先前學到的知識，「醫生遊戲」其實是一種帶有性暗示的遊戲。換句話說，拉著男生前往保健室的照顧病人行為，也很有可能被周圍人理解為某種帶有性暗示的行動──？）\n\n\n\n    在性的議題上疑神疑鬼──身為在深閨長大的千金小姐，輝夜的性知識還沒有辦法和現實世界順利銜接在一起。她的性知識水平僅相當於小學高年級生。\n\n\n\n    輝夜從過去的經驗中學習到，自己的主動出擊，有可能帶給周圍人超乎想像的巨大衝擊。\n\n\n\n    即使只是微乎其微，自己也應當避免做出帶有性暗示的發言。這就是輝夜推導出來的防禦策略。\n\n\n\n    （可是，就算如此，人家還是──）\n\n\n\n    輝夜微微握緊了拳頭，沒讓任何人注意到這個動作。\n\n\n\n    （這次不是平常的那種爾虞我詐。人家……沒錯，人家只是希望會長不要勉強自己的身體。畢竟會長平日就已經睡眠不足──再加上會長之所以還坐在『會長』的位子上，也是因為配合了我的任性……也說不定。）\n\n\n\n    輝夜很罕見地站在為別人著想的立場。她先是輕輕地吸了口氣，接著便下定決心地開口說道。\n\n\n\n    但是，輝夜還沒來得及出聲──\n\n\n\n    「啊，我想到一個好主意囉。」\n\n\n\n    藤原已經笑容滿面地搶先說出了這麼一句。\n\n\n\n    ♂♂♂\n\n\n\n    「假裝交往？」\n\n\n\n    白銀和輝夜忍不住異口同聲地說道，同時看向了對方的臉。\n\n\n\n    「──唔。」\n\n\n\n    下一個瞬間，白銀倏地把眼睛轉到一旁。四宮那雙莫名濕潤的眼眸，讓他的臉頰不由自主地發燙起來。仔細一看，四宮也和白銀一樣，害羞地低下了頭去。\n\n\n\n    「如果對方是聽不懂人話的傢伙，我們就通過具體的事實來讓他理解吧。輝夜同學若是已經有固定的交往對象，對方再怎麼樣都會懂得知難而退吧？」\n\n\n\n    而藤原完全沒有註意到兩人的異狀，徑自笑咪咪地繼續說明她的主意。\n\n\n\n    「不正當的男女交往……」\n\n\n\n    雖然伊井野嘟囔了這麼一句，不過也就僅此而已。對伊井野來說，即使只是假裝交往，恐怕也還是違反了她的道德標準。但是相比於男學生不斷投遞恐怖情書的行徑，這樣的權宜之計只能說是小巫見大巫，因此伊井野也默許了藤原的這項提議。\n\n\n\n    （──咦？假裝交往？和四宮？）\n\n\n\n    誰啊？我嗎？\n\n\n\n    （在石上會計外出的此刻，辦公室裡就只有我一個男生……換句話說，由我來和四宮假裝交往是理所當然的發展，其中沒有任何不自然的地方。）\n\n\n\n    白銀設想著各種情景，確認其中是否潛藏著什麼陷阱。\n\n\n\n    他觀察著輝夜的樣子，謹慎地研判藤原的發言是否有受到輝夜的唆使。\n\n\n\n    白銀甚至還測量了自己的脈搏，並且將自己的胳膊捏到紅腫，確認自己不是在妄想或作夢。\n\n\n\n    結果一切正常。\n\n\n\n    他沒有發現任何問題。\n\n\n\n    「唔……」\n\n\n\n    「會長，你覺得這主意如何呢？」\n\n\n\n    看著白銀以手抵顎、貌似陷入沉思的樣子，藤原開口徵詢他的意見。\n\n\n\n    「你的意思是，要由我來和四宮演對手戲──也就是擔任她的戀人角色？」\n\n\n\n    「沒錯。你們兩人分別是學生會長和副會長，我覺得是最適合扮演情侶的組合了。」\n\n\n\n    藤原興高采烈地說道。白銀不禁在內心振臂高呼。\n\n\n\n    這下子就拿到免死金牌了。\n\n\n\n    宣稱輝夜是「我的女人（My Love）」而引發的各種問題，全都能藉由這面金牌來化解。\n\n\n\n    （若是周圍人對我指指點點，我只需要這麼說就行了：「這只是身為學生會長的我，為了保護四宮所展現出來的演技而已。附帶一提，這是藤原書記提出來的主意。」）\n\n\n\n    白銀的思緒早已飄向了遠方。\n\n\n\n    所謂的假裝交往，該做哪些事情才會有說服力？\n\n\n\n    走在走廊上時牽著彼此的手，好向周圍的人們做出宣示──不許對我的女人出手。\n\n\n\n    午休時間交換彼此的便當菜色，當然是以張嘴互餵的方式──要把人家也吃掉？\n\n\n\n    放學後只有兩人的獨處時間。在沒有任何人知道的秘密場所，做著各種秘密的事情──內容當然是秘密啦！\n\n\n\n    太完美了。\n\n\n\n    而且假裝交往的真正美妙之處，其實是雙方在追求真實性的過程中，將會逐漸分不清演技和現實的界線。\n\n\n\n    ──史丹佛監獄實驗。\n\n\n\n    這是在一九七〇年代的美國實際進行過的心理實驗。這項實驗召集了一群素不相識的志願者，讓他們分別扮演「看守」和「囚犯」的角色。整場實驗始於扮演囚犯的志願者被逮捕上警車的場面，為的就是極力追求逼真的效果。囚犯被禁錮在模擬監獄之中，被迫過著屈辱的犯人生活。\n\n\n\n    隨著時間的推進，扮演看守的志願者，逐漸以高壓強硬的態度來對待扮演囚犯的志願者。不管這些看守的扮演者原本是什麼性格，他們最後都徹底融入角色之中，展現出符合看守形象的人格特質。\n\n\n\n    最後，面對逐漸失控的暴力行為及精神崩潰的志願者，這場實驗不得不宣告中止。\n\n\n\n    整場實驗從開始到結束，僅僅用了六天的時間而已。\n\n\n\n    （換句話說，我們只要扮演戀人的角色，就會在不知不覺中萌生出戀人的情感。而且這次為了勸退那名偏執的男學生，必須追求逼真無比的演出效果。我和四宮必然會做出戀人般的互動。）\n\n\n\n    ──「先喜歡上對方的人是輸家」，可說是絕對的鐵則。\n\n\n\n    然而，如果兩人是在沒有任何一方告白的情況下展開交往呢？\n\n\n\n    （據說在史丹佛監獄實驗中，就連心理學家都被這種異常真實的場面所震懾，忘記出面阻止看守扮演者的過度虐待行為。我和四宮只要認真扮演戀人的角色，就算是知道內情的藤原書記和伊井野，也會逐漸認定我們是一對真正的戀人吧。到了最後，現實和虛構的界線會變得模糊不清，我和四宮就……唔噢噢噢！這樣子行得通！這場漫長的戰爭終於可以畫下句點了！）\n\n\n\n    白銀興奮得雙手微微顫抖。這就是所謂的※武者震吧。（譯註：「武者震」是指武者面對即將到來的激戰，全身緊張得顫抖不已的生理現象，其中夾雜著恐懼與激昂的情感。）\n\n\n\n    就在這個瞬間，白銀注意到四宮的眼神變得銳利起來，但是他沒有特別多想什麼。\n\n\n\n    （你等著吧，四宮。就由我來守護你的安全。沒錯，由我來守護你。）\n\n\n\n    白銀嘆了口氣，刻意擺出興趣缺缺的表情說道：\n\n\n\n    「……藤原書記說得很有道理。我平日受了四宮的許多照顧，為她做這點事也是應該的。」\n\n\n\n    「不必了，會長。你的好意我心領了。」\n\n\n\n    輝夜以寒冰般的話語，二話不說地拒絕了白銀的自告奮勇。\n\n\n\n    「我認為石上同學才是最適合和我演對手戲的人。」\n\n\n\n    將調查問卷歸還給體育祭實行委員會的石上，恰好於此時回到了學生會辦公室；輝夜一邊看著走進房裡的石上，一邊如此說道。\n\n\n\n    ♀♀♀\n\n\n\n    輝夜很敏銳地捕捉到了白銀的變化。\n\n\n\n    （會長從剛才開始就臉頰發燙，呼吸也變得相當粗重，這些都是身體發燒的症狀啊。）\n\n\n\n    再加上白銀冷不防地猛然顫抖了起來，輝夜不禁如此尋思道。\n\n\n\n    （這是在畏寒發抖吧。我得趕快讓會長躺下來休息才行。）\n\n\n\n    「……藤原書記說得很有道理。我平日受了四宮的許多照顧，為她做這點事也是應該的。」\n\n\n\n    聽到白銀的這番發言，輝夜瞬間下定了決心。\n\n\n\n    （會長，我也是一樣的心情──不對，應該說我才是平日受到你最多照顧的人。我如果不向你報答這份恩情，將是我們四宮家的奇恥大辱！）\n\n\n\n    「不必了，會長。你的好意我心領了。」\n\n\n\n    沒錯，白銀總是被學生會長的繁重事務壓得喘不過氣來，偶爾也該讓他在罹患感冒的時候休息一下才對。\n\n\n\n    正好就在這個時候，能夠代打的人選也回來了。\n\n\n\n    輝夜看著石上，嫣然一笑地說道：\n\n\n\n    「我認為石上同學才是最適合和我演對手戲的人。你說是吧？石上同學。」\n\n\n\n    「咦、欸？」\n\n\n\n    完全搞不清楚狀況的石上，只能驚慌失措地看著輝夜的臉孔。\n\n\n\n    ♂♂♂\n\n\n\n    （怎麼搞的？現在是什麼狀況啊。）\n\n\n\n    白銀努力試圖掌握目前的局勢。\n\n\n\n    藤原提出了「假裝交往」的主意。白銀和輝夜只要順水推舟地附和這個提案，應該就能達成雙贏的結果，獲得以戀人身分交往這樣的好處。\n\n\n\n    然而，輝夜卻拒絕了這項提案。她這是什麼意思？\n\n\n\n    白銀立刻就察覺到了輝夜的意圖。\n\n\n\n    （在挑選假裝交往的對象時，當然是以本人的意志為最優先。我充其量只是可能的選項之一。如果四宮希望和石上會計組成搭檔，旁人對此提出異議只會顯得很不自然。而且我如果在這時候說出「我想要扮演四宮的戀人角色」，那豈不是──）\n\n\n\n    那豈不是和告白沒兩樣。\n\n\n\n    也就是宣告了白銀的敗北。\n\n\n\n    （四宮這傢伙，居然在這種地方設下了陷講──她是想要取得完全的壓倒性勝利嗎？）\n\n\n\n    戀愛即戰爭。而四宮輝夜這名少女，並不打算通過和平協議來結束這場戰爭。\n\n\n\n    白銀做了個深呼吸，瞬間下定了決心。\n\n\n\n    （行啊，既然你這麼希望開戰，那我就和你奉陪到底！）\n\n\n\n    此刻的白銀必須迅速採取行動。正所謂兵貴神速。他得搶在藤原等人說出「那麼就決定是石上同學囉」以前發動攻勢。\n\n\n\n    「噢？那麼我順便問一句，目前在場的男生就只有我和石上會計而已，四宮，你是基於什麼理由選擇了他？在假裝交往的作戰中，最關鍵的環節就是真實感，而且要足以騙過這封恐嚇信──不對，這封情書的寄信人。你是認為你和石上會計的搭配，能夠達到如此逼真的演出效果？」\n\n\n\n    在雙方意見發生分歧的時候，與其列舉己方的優點，倒不如直接攻擊對方的缺點會更有效果。\n\n\n\n    雖然說是這麼說，但是白銀無法在這種情況下攻擊石上的缺點。因為這種會傷害到可愛學弟的行為，完全和白銀奉行的理念背道而馳──他絕對不會犧牲他人來成就自己。\n\n\n\n    因此白銀的基本戰術，就是先詢問輝夜為何選擇石上來飾演戀人，接著再針對她的理由發動攻擊。如此一來，石上本人就不會直接遭到攻擊，從而也就避免了受傷的可能。\n\n\n\n    「說得是呢。真實感的確是最重要的環節。石上同學最近很努力地在改變自己，甚至還為此加入了應援團，而我很欣賞他的這份努力，這就成了我決定和他交往的理由，你們覺得這樣子如何呢？畢竟一旦裝出交往的樣子，旁人就一定會問到交往的契機。」\n\n\n\n    輝夜從容不迫地說道。\n\n\n\n    聽完輝夜的理由，白銀立刻尋思著如何反駁。\n\n\n\n    「咦？我和四宮學姊？呃，欸？那我的意見呢？」好不容易稍微理解狀況的石上，臉色蒼白地如此囁嚅道，但是沒有人理會他的反應。\n\n\n\n    「嗯……雖然我也覺得石上會計的心境變化很了不起，但是看在其他人的眼中又是如何呢？如果有一個更值得欣賞的人就在你的身旁，這樣的交往契機會不會顯得不夠真實呢？」\n\n\n\n    這句話的弦外之音就是：「我可是秀知院學園史上唯三的混院學生會長，而且還是成功連任兩屆的學生會長喔」。\n\n\n\n    然而，輝夜完全不為所動。\n\n\n\n    「有句話是這麼說的：『值得尊敬的不是那些比別人更優秀的人，而是比過去的自己更優秀的人』。會長，你的確是一位卓越不凡的人物。不僅是學年首席，還兼任學生會長一職──但是，你從以前開始就是如此優秀。事到如今，我如果還以這些事情作為欣賞你的理由，會不會有些缺乏說服力呢？」\n\n\n\n    「唔…… 」\n\n\n\n    白銀頓時說不出話來，就在這時……\n\n\n\n    「原來如此，這樣的確是說得通呢。」\n\n\n\n    令人意外的是，伊井野居然出聲贊同了輝夜的看法。\n\n\n\n    學生會的成員都很清楚，伊井野異常地厭惡石上。因此她的這句發言，讓在場眾人都忍不住面露驚訝之色。\n\n\n\n    「四宮副會長的意見確實很有真實感。如果讓我來把它編成一個簡單明瞭的故事，大概會是這個樣子。」\n\n\n\n    於是伊井野便在所有人的注視之下，豎起一根食指娓娓道來。\n\n\n\n    ♀♀♀\n\n\n\n    比如說，有這麼一個故事──\n\n\n\n    某一天，又懶又廢的石上走在走廊上。\n\n\n\n    因為他是個又蠢又笨又不守法的傢伙，所以在走路的時候也還是玩著手上的掌機。再加上頭上還戴著耳機，因此完全隔絕了周圍的視野和聲音。\n\n\n\n    大家也要謹記，走路的時候不要玩手機或戴耳機喔！\n\n\n\n    只要稍有不注意，就很有可能發生事故。\n\n\n\n    我想石上也遲早會嚐到苦頭，並且痛心疾首地如此懺悔道：「原來風紀委員平時對我耳提面命的那些事情，全都是正確的啊。唯有遵守規則才能夠保護自己和心愛的人。我居然連這麼簡單的道理都不明白，真的是天字第一號的大傻瓜啊。」\n\n\n\n    果不其然，愚蠢的石上在轉角處撞到了擦肩而過的人。\n\n\n\n    「啊。」\n\n\n\n    「好痛。」\n\n\n\n    被忘恩負義且任性妄為的石上撞到的，是一位身形嬌小的女學生。\n\n\n\n    石上唧唧咕咕地用他噁心的聲音，向女學生嘟囔了一句道歉，隨即就想要拍拍屁股走人，但是在看到對方的臉孔之後，他不由自主地倒抽了一口涼氣。\n\n\n\n    「不好意思，是我走路太不小心──哎呀，原來是石上同學啊？……你那個遊戲機和耳機是怎麼回事？」\n\n\n\n    沒錯，石上撞到的那名女學生正是四宮副會長。\n\n\n\n    四宮副會長在意識到是石上不對之後，立刻換上了冷酷的眼神，彷彿變了個人似的。\n\n\n\n    平常總是笑容滿面的四宮副會長，用冰冷的視線貫穿了石上，那是為達目的、不擇手段的人所獨有的眼神。\n\n\n\n    「……看來，你有必要重新接受教育。」\n\n\n\n    「咿──！？」\n\n\n\n    四宮副會長徹底整治了品行不端的石上。\n\n\n\n    首先，作為反省的起點，她把石上那頭雜亂無章、看了就令人不愉快的頭髮剃了個精光。外表的雜亂就是風紀的紊亂。因此如果要整頓風紀，首先該做的就是整理外表。\n\n\n\n    「呵呵，在陰鬱的瀏海消失之後，整個人都變得清爽起來了呢，石上同學，簡直像是個小和尚似的。放心吧，你馬上就能迎來脫胎換骨的變化。你只要專心念誦經文，就會潛移默化成一個更好的人囉。」\n\n\n\n    「咿──！？」\n\n\n\n    ……於是原本品行不端的石上，在四宮副會長的手下得到了重生，兩人也自然而然地發展成了情侶關係。\n\n\n\n    理了個大光頭、就此洗心革面的石上，和從旁教育引導著他的四宮副會長，就這樣成了秀知院學園公認的最理想情侶。\n\n\n\n    「不過啊，石上同學，雖說我們是一對情侶，但是你如果敢碰我一根手指頭，我可是會懲罰你的喔？畢竟我們作為秀知院學園的模範情侶，必須要保持正當純潔的男女交往關係才行。」\n\n\n\n    「好的──我明白了──我明白了──小人是您──忠實的男朋友──」\n\n\n\n    儘管石上依舊又廢又笨，但是在四宮副會長的指導之下，也逐漸變得不會做出過去的那些愚蠢行為了。\n\n\n\n    可喜可賀，可喜可賀。\n\n\n\n    ♂♂♂\n\n\n\n    「──綜上所述，四宮副會長在令石上重獲新生之後，兩人順勢展開交往的情節具有相當的真實感。因為石上那頭糟糕到不行的長發會被剃成和尚頭，所以其他人在看到如此明顯的外表變化之後，也會自然而然地接受他們兩人是一對戀人的事實吧。」\n\n\n\n    「不，這很不自然吧？莫名其妙地理了個和尚頭，只會讓別人覺得這傢伙在搞什麼飛機而已。只因為被女生要求就剃成和尚頭，說起來也非常奇怪吧？還有啊，伊井野，你對石上的惡意也太超過了。在剛才的故事裡，你每次提到石上的時候，都會加上『愚蠢』或『傻瓜』之類的形容詞，再怎麼說這樣都有點太過分了吧？」\n\n\n\n    看著伊井野一臉陶醉地講出惡毒的話語，白銀忍不住直接開口吐槽。\n\n\n\n    石上以仰望救世主般的眼神看向白銀，點頭如搗蒜地附和著他的話。\n\n\n\n    遭到白銀反駁的伊井野，則是面若寒霜地用力指著石上說道：\n\n\n\n    「和尚頭和禿頭是不一樣的。因為頭髮剃光之後還會再長回來，所以恰好可以用來象徵一個人的成長。為了重新長出沒有染上奇怪顏色和造型的頭髮，從而痛下決心剌掉三千煩惱絲的行為，正是一種渴望重新做人的象徵！所以說和尚頭很帥沒錯吧！」\n\n\n\n    「別在這裡強迫推銷你的性癖好啊！」\n\n\n\n    看著伊井野的狂熱模樣，白銀不禁感到一陣毛骨悚然。\n\n\n\n    「會長，你在表達反對意見的時候，能不能提出其他替代方案呢？你覺得什麼樣的交往契機，才能讓其他人感受到真實性呢？」\n\n\n\n    「唔，我嗎？」\n\n\n\n    白銀以手抵顎，做出沉思片刻的模樣。\n\n\n\n    「也就是說，要我來提出和四宮的交往契機是嗎？那麼，你們覺得這樣的劇情如何──」\n\n\n\n    雖然輝夜一臉笑咪咪的樣子，但她其實是以凝視獵物的眼神緊盯著白銀。\n\n\n\n    明確地感受到這道視線的白銀，就這樣開始述說他的故事。\n\n\n\n    ♂♂♂\n\n\n\n    比如說，有這麼一個故事──\n\n\n\n    某一天，我和四宮兩人單獨在學生會辦公室處理工作。\n\n\n\n    畢竟我們學生會的成員都相當優秀，除了學生會以外，還參加了其他社團和委員會，因此每個人都相當忙碌。只有我們兩人待在辦公室的情形並不罕見。\n\n\n\n    我和四宮針對學生會的工作發了幾句牢騷。\n\n\n\n    當然，我們並不是真心在抱怨。\n\n\n\n    我也是因為喜歡這些工作，才會出馬競選學生會長的寶座。\n\n\n\n    處理著繁瑣事務工作的我們，在短暫的休息時間裡，聊到了下次放假真想去哪裡走走的話題。\n\n\n\n    於是四宮表示，她身上剛好有某個地方的折價券或入場券。\n\n\n\n    這真的是純粹的偶然。畢竟四宮家是那樣的豪門世家，必然有許多機會得到這一類的優惠券。因此我也很清楚，這真的只是偶然而已。\n\n\n\n    我想想……就假設四宮這次帶在身上的，是電影的優惠券好了──\n\n\n\n    不對，不能是電影。\n\n\n\n    不能的理由是什麼？\n\n\n\n    因為即使兩人一起去了電影院，也不一定會坐在相鄰的位子啊。\n\n\n\n    什麼？不可能有這種事情？兩人一起去電影院的話，沒理由坐在不相鄰的位子？\n\n\n\n    這種事情是存在的喔，大千世界可是無奇不有，沒有什麼事情是絕對的。不知為何就坐在不相鄰的位子上觀賞電影，對我們兩人來說是非常有可能發生的情形。\n\n\n\n    不說這個了。總之電影是行不通的。電影院不行的話，那就換成水族館好了──\n\n\n\n    不對，也不能是水族館。\n\n\n\n    因為對某人來說，我們現在身處的場所，可能就已經是水族館了吧？\n\n\n\n    什麼？聽不懂我在說什麼？\n\n\n\n    呃，老實說，我自己也不太懂這句話是什麼意思，總之就是這麼回事。\n\n\n\n    就讓我來告訴你們過去發生的真實故事吧。我的朋友曾經邀請某位女性前往水族館，結果這裡不知什麼時候就變成了水族館。\n\n\n\n    換句話說，水族館也是不可行的選項。\n\n\n\n    因此就是──\n\n\n\n    ♀♀♀\n\n\n\n    「好了！卡卡卡！完全不行啊！根本沒有半點真實感可言！會長的方案無條件否決！」\n\n\n\n    雖然白銀還想要繼續說下去，藤原卻「嗶嗶」地吹著哨子打斷了他的話。只見藤原的袖子上頭，不知何時已經別著一個寫有【心動裁判】的臂章。\n\n\n\n    「會長提出的理想邂逅及告白場景，只能拿到零分而已。請你下次繼續努力。」\n\n\n\n    「餵，什麼時候變成這種遊戲了啊？我可沒聽說啊。」\n\n\n\n    白銀在說完這麼一句之後，就此不發一語。\n\n\n\n    輝夜偷看著白銀默默低頭的表情，在心中如此思付道。\n\n\n\n    （會長果然是身體不舒服呢。居然說出如此不知所云的話來。而且如果是平常的他，面對藤原同學的蠻橫態度，應該還會再多抱怨幾句才對。他肯定是因為發燒的關係，無法進行有條理的思考……藤原同學也真是的，好歹在這種時候體恤一下會長的身體啊。）\n\n\n\n    輝夜的這番願望，當然不可能傳達到藤原那裡。只見藤原一臉興致盎然地催促著繼續遊戲。\n\n\n\n    「好啦，那麼接下來就輪到輝夜同學囉。」\n\n\n\n    「我也要參加？」\n\n\n\n    「當然囉。大家可是為了你才策劃了這次的作戰喔。那麼，有請輝夜同學發表你心中的理想邂逅及告白場景。」\n\n\n\n    最喜歡戀愛話題的藤原，完全是兩眼放光的狂熱狀態。\n\n\n\n    輝夜將手摀在嘴邊，略微思索了一下。\n\n\n\n    （若是換做平常時候，這的確會是很有意思的遊戲。只要巧妙利用這場遊戲，應該能夠對會長造成有效的攻擊。但是，現在必須以會長的身體健康為優先。我得盡快結束這場遊戲才行。畢竟會長的狀況看起來已經相當糟糕了。那麼，這場遊戲的勝利條件是──）\n\n\n\n    輝夜用眼角瞥了一眼石上。就在那一瞬間，石上整個人都哆嗦了起來。\n\n\n\n    「咦？怎麼回事？為什麼有股惡寒……」\n\n\n\n    「你如果感冒了，就把口罩戴上好嗎？要是傳染給了別人，可是會給別人添麻煩的。還有晚上睡覺時要做好保暖措施，別再繼續通宵達旦地玩電動遊戲啊。」\n\n\n\n    聽到石上的喃喃自語，伊井野毫不留情地如此說道。\n\n\n\n    （這場遊戲的勝利條件，是編出一個能夠合理解釋我和石上同學交往的故事。老實說，我完全沒把石上同學當成戀愛對像看待，但是我隨便都能想出好幾個邂逅及告白場景，要說服藤原同學他們根本不算什麼難事。）\n\n\n\n    輝夜只思考了一個呼吸的時間，便娓娓道來地講述了起來。\n\n\n\n    ♀♀♀\n\n\n\n    比如說，有這麼一個故事──\n\n\n\n    關於我和石上同學的邂逅，我想就不必重新贅述了吧？\n\n\n\n    然後，我為何會將石上同學當成戀愛對象的來龍去脈──我只需要講述這部分就可以了吧？\n\n\n\n    那麼，石上同學加入應援團這件事情，果然還是最自然的契機呢。\n\n\n\n    我和石上同學在此之前，就只是學生會中的學姊和學弟的關係。\n\n\n\n    石上同學在工作上非常能幹，但是在課業上相當漫不經心，這點讓我有些看不過去。這麼說起來，我還曾經指導過他功課呢。\n\n\n\n    石上同學，我當時提醒過你之後也要認真複習，你有遵照我的吩咐去做嗎？\n\n\n\n    請你看著我的眼睛回答。\n\n\n\n    ……哼，也罷，暫且不說這件事情。\n\n\n\n    總而言之，在石上同學加入應援團之後，我和他的接觸機會其實多了不少。\n\n\n\n    像是把我的製服借給他、教他怎麼化妝之類的──\n\n\n\n    ♀♀♀\n\n\n\n    輝夜說到這裡，忽然注意到了白銀的異狀。\n\n\n\n    只見白銀的整個臉頰都鼓了起來。\n\n\n\n    （咦？會長？怎麼突然就變成這個樣子？）\n\n\n\n    輝夜納悶地看著白銀的那副表情，腦中突然想起了一件事情。\n\n\n\n    （原來如此，會長是罹患了「豬頭皮」啊！所以他的臉頰才會腫脹得如此嚴重！）\n\n\n\n    「豬頭皮」是一般的俗稱，正確的學名為「流行性腮腺炎」。\n\n\n\n    作為病毒性傳染病的腮腺炎，是一種常見的兒童疾病，而在成年以後才染上腮腺炎的人，症狀通常會比兒童來得嚴重。\n\n\n\n    由於相對應的疫苗早已研發出來，輝夜小時候也施打過該種疫苗，因此她罹患腮腺炎的機率可說是微乎其微。\n\n\n\n    可是，既然白銀罹患腮腺炎已是不爭的事實，那麼事態就變得急迫了起來。\n\n\n\n    原因在於，腮腺炎是會導致各種並發症的危險疾病，病情嚴重者甚至有可能因此失聰或不孕。\n\n\n\n    不孕症。這是輝夜絕對無法坐視不管的並發症。\n\n\n\n    （會長曾經說過，他想要多生一點孩子，多到能夠組棒球隊的地步……我可不能讓他的夢想在這種地方破滅！）\n\n\n\n    輝夜的眼中燃起了決心的火焰。\n\n\n\n    只聽她以更加熱情洋溢的語調，繼續述說著能夠合理解釋自己和石上交往的故事。\n\n\n\n    原本只被自己視作路邊石頭的石上，為何能夠成為自己的戀愛對象？輝夜使出渾身解數，透過各式各樣的插曲軼事，讓整個故事變得無比立體豐滿。\n\n\n\n    藤原和伊井野都忍不住為之嘆息。\n\n\n\n    然而，輝夜心中的焦急卻是愈演愈烈。\n\n\n\n    因為隨著時間的推進，白銀的臉頰愈腫愈大，看起來只要用針一戳就會直接爆炸開來的樣子。\n\n\n\n    （唔──不妙啊。再這樣下去，會長可是會絕子絕孫的啊！）\n\n\n\n    和內心的焦急相反，輝夜的講述方式變得更加精妙，語氣也充滿了熱情。\n\n\n\n    但是，負責講述故事的輝夜愈是覺得自己說得精彩，白銀臉頰的腫脹程度就變得愈是厲害。\n\n\n\n    縱使是精神堅強的白銀，似乎也承受不了這樣的轟炸，只見他的眼中已經有淚光在閃動。\n\n\n\n    （已經到極限了，就用下一則插曲來決勝負！）\n\n\n\n    輝夜已下定決心。\n\n\n\n    「……然後，我和石上的關係，迎來了關鍵性的轉折點。」\n\n\n\n    說完這麼一句，輝夜刻意停頓了一下。因為這樣子能夠將聽眾的注意力都集中過來。\n\n\n\n    輝夜的企圖果然成功了。藤原整個人都沉浸在輝夜的故事裡，伊井野也一臉入迷地湊上前來。\n\n\n\n    只是石上不知為何縮在房間的角落瑟瑟發抖；白銀則是一臉泫然欲泣的表情。不過，那也到此為止了。輝夜已經從各種角度驗證過了，接下來的這則夢幻插曲足以說服任何人。\n\n\n\n    「究、究竟是什麼樣的轉折點……？」\n\n\n\n    藤原迫不及待地插嘴問道。\n\n\n\n    「那是──」\n\n\n\n    只聽到「咕嘟」一聲，也不曉得是誰吞了一口唾液。\n\n\n\n    輝夜在賣足了關子之後，才開始講述起這則插曲。\n\n\n\n    這則「令人瞬間墜入愛河」的插曲，不管是誰聽了都會為之動容。\n\n\n\n    輝夜所構思出來的必殺插曲就是──\n\n\n\n    「在某個下雨的日子裡，我看到石上同學撐傘庇護著一隻被遺棄的小狗。」\n\n\n\n    「…………」\n\n\n\n    「……… …」\n\n\n\n    很感人對吧？──只見輝夜信心十足地等待藤原和伊井野的反應。\n\n\n\n    面對這太過羅曼蒂克的劇情，藤原和伊井野似乎都傻眼到說不出話來。\n\n\n\n    「好啦，你覺得如何呢？藤原同學，你的感想是？」\n\n\n\n    輝夜以自信滿滿的表情詢問聽眾的意見。\n\n\n\n    然而，藤原卻做出了意想不到的反應。\n\n\n\n    「噗──」\n\n\n\n    「……咦？」\n\n\n\n    輝夜一時搞不清楚是什麼狀況。\n\n\n\n    她甚至開始擔心藤原是不是也得了腮腺炎，所以才會發出這種類似咳嗽的怪聲。\n\n\n\n    但是，藤原緊接著發出的噗哧笑聲，讓輝夜明白了事情並不是她所想的那樣。\n\n\n\n    「沒想到最後居然急轉直下，出現了這種超級老掉牙的劇情呢。哎，我覺得這樣也很不錯啦。嗯，這年頭已經很少聽人提起雨中小狗之類的狗血場面了呢。或許反而能給人歷久彌新的感覺？嗯，是個非常可愛的故事。」\n\n\n\n    「非常可愛的故事！？」\n\n\n\n    輝夜頓時感到啞口無言，緊接著心頭驀地湧起一股羞恥感。\n\n\n\n    （人家──沒錯，人家只是想要讓會長盡快躺下休息，為什麼非得在這裡被藤原同學當成傻瓜看待啊？不對，真要說起來，我之所以被強迫參加這場愚蠢的遊戲，還不都是因為藤原同學的關係！）\n\n\n\n    輝夜以惡狠狠的眼神瞪向藤原。\n\n\n\n    「咿──！？」\n\n\n\n    縮在房間角落的石上，發出了膽怯的驚叫聲。\n\n\n\n    ♂♂♂\n\n\n\n    白銀有種身處風暴中心的感覺。\n\n\n\n    「所以說，我如果要找一個人假裝交往，我會選擇石上同學！既然身為當事人的我都這麼推薦了，這件事情已經沒有什麼好討論的了吧！」\n\n\n\n    「輝夜同學，這只是你的一己之見而已。其他人能不能接受這樣的人選，才是問題的真正關鍵所在。如果你挑選出來的對象騙不過其他人，那就沒有任何意義了。所以我們才會在這裡追求具有真實性的故事啊。」\n\n\n\n    輝夜和藤原兩人，展開了激烈的言語交鋒。\n\n\n\n    旁人完全沒有插嘴的餘地。\n\n\n\n    「那我們就來問問其他人的看法吧……我說，伊井野同學，你對於我選擇石上同學作為假裝交往的對象，應該沒有任何異議吧？」\n\n\n\n    「咦！？？嗯、嗯……沒錯，我覺得這樣子就可以了。」\n\n\n\n    伊井野一臉快要哭出來的樣子，唯唯諾諾地同意了輝夜的說法。\n\n\n\n    「看吧，其他人也這麼說了。我選擇石上同學作為假裝交往的對象，果然是正確的決定。既然我本人都這麼說了，那就肯定不會有錯。」\n\n\n\n    「那個……我的意見呢……」\n\n\n\n    石上畏畏縮縮地舉手說道，可是沒有任何人理會他的訴求。\n\n\n\n    （唔！不妙啊，再這樣下去就無力回天了！）\n\n\n\n    儘管心急如焚，但是白銀絞盡腦汁也想不出逆轉的妙計。\n\n\n\n    照這個勢頭髮展下去，輝夜的戀人角色很快就會敲定由石上來飾演。白銀無論如何都得阻止這種情況發生。\n\n\n\n    他得設法找出幾個理由，證明輝夜和石上交往會顯得相當不自然──\n\n\n\n    不，其實白銀能夠想出無數的理由，但是這樣子對石上實在太過殘忍，因此他沒有辦法說出口。更準確來說，浮現在白銀腦海之中的，全是針對石上個人的批評，甚至多到會妨礙思考的程度。\n\n\n\n    （石上──雖然我覺得你是一個值得尊敬的人物，但是你身上那些有待改進的部分，能不能想個辦法改善一下啊！）\n\n\n\n    白銀心中的吶喊，當然沒能傳達給任何人。\n\n\n\n    儘管場面一片混亂，不過學生會辦公室內的局勢開始趨於穩定──而在這個節骨眼上再次吹皺一池春水的，果然還是那位奇女子。\n\n\n\n    「給我稍等一下！」\n\n\n\n    只見藤原脫下獵鹿帽高聲叫道。\n\n\n\n    （……藤原書記？）\n\n\n\n    她為何要在這種時候摘下戀愛偵探的正字標記？真要說起來，那頂帽子真的是有必要的東西嗎？特地把蝴蝶結係到帽子上到底有什麼意義啊？\n\n\n\n    白銀的心中滿是困惑。\n\n\n\n    他完全沒辦法解讀藤原的行動。白銀的腦袋在秀知院學園中堪稱頂級水平，但即使是這樣的他，也無法理解藤原的思考邏輯。\n\n\n\n    然而正是因為如此，藤原的發言甚至具有摧毀輝夜論點的力量。\n\n\n\n    （拜託你了，藤原書記。全靠你力挽狂瀾了……即使無法扭轉局勢，只要能攪亂目前的局面就已經非常足夠了。）\n\n\n\n    白銀在內心如此祈求，等待著藤原的下一句話。\n\n\n\n    「有人比石上同學更能勝任這個角色！」\n\n\n\n    （很好！就是這樣。接下來就是把我的名字說出來。）\n\n\n\n    白銀攥緊了拳頭，等待著藤原的下一句話。\n\n\n\n    就在這時，一絲不安劃過他的心頭。白銀都快記不清自己被藤原的奇葩言行折騰過多少回了──但是，這次不一樣。\n\n\n\n    白銀堅定不移地等待著藤原的發言。\n\n\n\n    「那個人──」\n\n\n\n    （哪個人？）\n\n\n\n    決定命運的瞬間。緊張到極點的白銀，整個人幾乎都快要昏厥過去了。\n\n\n\n    「就是會長！」\n\n\n\n    （是我啊──！很好！幹得好啊！藤原書記！）\n\n\n\n    白銀差點興奮地喊出聲來，急忙假裝咳嗽掩飾了過去。\n\n\n\n    可是，因為突如其來的轉機而失去冷靜的白銀，沒能注意到藤原的表情其實有些不高興。\n\n\n\n    「咳──咳──嗯，所以說，藤原書記，你推薦我的理由是？」\n\n\n\n    藤原有些鬧彆扭地嘟囔道：\n\n\n\n    「如果要比成長的話，會長才是成長更多的人。你們根本就不曉得會長是怎麼呼來喚去地使喚人家……」\n\n\n\n    「餵、餵，藤原書記……」\n\n\n\n    藤原顯然是在說每次幫白銀做特訓的事情。\n\n\n\n    白銀本人當然沒有任意驅使藤原的意思，但是他也很清楚每次的特訓，都帶給藤原很大的責任壓力和身心負擔。\n\n\n\n    「人家可是超級努力的耶！！」\n\n\n\n    然而，作為特訓結果的成長若是遭到否定，將導致藤原先前付出的辛勞全都付諸東流。\n\n\n\n    她的怒火就是來自於此。\n\n\n\n    但是，藤原意外地是個口風很緊的人。只要是對方希望保密的事情，在任何情況下她都不會洩漏半個字出去。這也是藤原能和四宮輝夜保持長久友誼的主因之一。因此在觸及白銀特訓的話題時，她當然會把內容說得有些模糊不清。\n\n\n\n    「人家可是教導會長各種技巧的人啊！」\n\n\n\n    「注意一下你的說話方式啊！！」\n\n\n\n    模糊不清的表達方式往往會招致誤解，此乃世間的常理。\n\n\n\n    「人家可是一步一步地教會了會長各式各樣的事情！」\n\n\n\n    「我知道了！我下次不會再麻煩你了啦！」\n\n\n\n    「需要的時候就一個勁兒地求人家；不需要的時候就腳踢開人家！會長真是個過分的男人！請你負起責任！」\n\n\n\n    「你這傢伙是腦子進水了嗎！？」\n\n\n\n    儘管藤原本人毫無自覺，但是在旁人耳中聽來，白銀簡直就是個不折不扣的渣男。\n\n\n\n    白銀連忙確認周圍人的反應，只見伊井野的臉色一會兒蒼白一會兒羞紅；石上則是嘴裡嘟囔了一句「藤原學姊又發作了」，讓白銀多少感到有些寬慰。\n\n\n\n    那麼，最重要的是四宮有什麼反應……白銀提心吊膽地將視線轉往輝夜的方向。\n\n\n\n    ♀♀♀\n\n\n\n    ──人家可是一步一步地教會了會長各式各樣的事情！\n\n\n\n    （藤原同學說的『各式各樣的事情』，究竟是指哪些事情啊？）\n\n\n\n    在此還是要重申一下，四宮輝夜的性知識水平，僅相當於小學高年級生。\n\n\n\n    相對於此，「一步一步地教會了各式各樣的事情」則是中學生水平的問題，因此這樣的表達方式，並不會讓輝夜聯想到「那方面」的事情。\n\n\n\n    此刻的輝夜更擔心的是白銀的病情。\n\n\n\n    「這是什麼情況啊……呃，哎，不是這樣的，四宮……」\n\n\n\n    白銀的嗓音嘶啞，幾乎聽不太到。平日說話鏗鏘有力的他，居然會發出如此有氣無力的聲音，顯見事態已經相當危急。\n\n\n\n    而且打從藤原千花那樣大吵大鬧以來，白銀的臉色似乎就變得更加蒼白。輝夜真希望她別那樣大聲喧嘩，害得會長也跟著興奮激動起來。\n\n\n\n    現在不是繼續廢話的時候了。\n\n\n\n    輝夜已經決定不惜訴諸武力。\n\n\n\n    她用比平常強硬的語氣開口說道：\n\n\n\n    「藤原同學！」\n\n\n\n    「咿。」\n\n\n\n    對輝夜的呼喚聲做出反應的不是藤原，而是蜷縮得比平常更加小只、整個人哆嗦不已的伊井野，但是輝夜沒有放在心上。\n\n\n\n    「喂喂，伊井野，光是這種程度就嚇到發抖可不行喔？你這樣子在面對認真起來的四宮學姊時，可是會連站都站不起來喔？」\n\n\n\n    石上嘲笑著渾身哆嗦的伊井野。將音量壓得很低的他，顯然沒打算讓輝夜聽到這番話，但聲音還是清楚地傳了過去。\n\n\n\n    輝夜看著幸災樂禍的石上說道：\n\n\n\n    「我決定和石上同學一起扮演戀人。不容許任何人的反駁。」\n\n\n\n    石上頓時癱軟了下去。\n\n\n\n    ♂♂♂\n\n\n\n    白銀抱著石上大喊道：\n\n\n\n    「石上啊────！」\n\n\n\n    對石上來說，輝夜方才的那句宣告，就像是在以為死裡逃生的時候，被一支尖銳的冰柱猛然捅進解除警戒的心窩。\n\n\n\n    石上在痙攣地抽搐幾下之後……便再也沒有任何動作了。\n\n\n\n    （為什麼會變成這個樣子！）\n\n\n\n    這是石上和白銀的共同心聲。\n\n\n\n    （四宮該不會是真的覺得，我和藤原有什麼奇怪的關係吧……？）\n\n\n\n    「……不是的，四宮……這完全只是你的誤解……！」\n\n\n\n    就在白銀想要開口辯解的時候，藤原抽抽噎噎地哭了起來。\n\n\n\n    「哪裡有什麼誤解啊……你明明就用各種方式玩弄人家，甚至還……還用海參來……！」\n\n\n\n    （海參是什麼鬼啊！你這完全是在仙人跳吧！）\n\n\n\n    白銀還沒來得及開口反駁，輝夜就已經搶在他的前頭，不由分說地向藤原說道：\n\n\n\n    「藤原同學，請你不要（大聲喧嘩）害會長興奮激動起來好嗎？」\n\n\n\n    「我沒有興奮激動起來啊……」\n\n\n\n    只見白銀的臉色唰地變得慘白。輝夜自不必說，其他人看到白銀的這副慘澹模樣，大概也會認為他生病了吧。\n\n\n\n    輝夜的眼中流露出銳利的光芒，彷彿出鞘的武士刀一樣鋒利。\n\n\n\n    儘管畏懼於對方眼神的魄力，白銀還是像在懇求輝夜似地伸出手去。\n\n\n\n    「聽……聽我說啊，四宮，拜託你相信我啊……我不是那樣的渣男……」\n\n\n\n    「請你別再說話了。」\n\n\n\n    「咦……」\n\n\n\n    「會長，你可是有病在身的人。」\n\n\n\n    白銀頓時癱軟了下去。\n\n\n\n    在那之後發生的事情，白銀只有朦朧的記憶。\n\n\n\n    藤原聲淚倶下地控訴著「人家明明那麼努力地栽培了會長」；伊井野則是賊頭賊腦地想要打探出何謂「各式各樣的事情」。\n\n\n\n    而輝夜就這樣拖著白銀和動也不動的石上，三人一起不知道消失到了哪兒去。\n\n\n\n    ♂♂♂\n\n\n\n    做夢真是一件不可思議的事情。\n\n\n\n    人類的大腦會在睡覺時整理白天得到的資訊，將它們分為「必要的記憶」和「不必要的記憶」。\n\n\n\n    雖然不曉得是什麼樣的原理，但是大腦會自動進行篩選，決定該把哪些記憶保留下來。\n\n\n\n    說來相當諷刺，當事人想要遺忘的記憶，基本上都會被保留下來。畢竟那些受到傷害或遭遇危險的經驗，正是最能幫助人類有效地生存下去的智慧。\n\n\n\n    因此我做的夢幾乎都是惡夢。\n\n\n\n    ──餵，你找到了嗎？\n\n\n\n    「唔哇，請問你是哪位？」\n\n\n\n    有一位少女正在盪著鞦韆。\n\n\n\n    掛著鞦韆的樹木也不知道是否還存活，隨著少女的擺盪動作嘎吱作響。為什麼非要在這種搖搖欲墜的樹上盪鞦韆啊？這樣子超級危險的耶。\n\n\n\n    「餵，你找到了嗎？」\n\n\n\n    「你說的『找到』，是指什麼東西啊？」\n\n\n\n    少女擺盪著身體說道：\n\n\n\n    「本小姐的心愛之物。」\n\n\n\n    我看不太清楚少女的表情。至少看起來不像是在笑的樣子。不過這種打禪機似的對話，我倒也不覺得討厭就是了。\n\n\n\n    少女問我是否找到了她的心愛之物。嗯～視心愛之物的具體內容，這個問題的答案有許多不同的可能。換句話說，這個問題的重點或許不在心愛之物本身。如果是這樣子的話……她想說的是「尋找的方法」？\n\n\n\n    「心愛之物這種東西不靠自己尋找出來，豈不是就沒有任何意義了嗎？」\n\n\n\n    少女依舊不停擺盪著身體。\n\n\n\n    感覺很奇怪。\n\n\n\n    「因為本小姐沒辦法自己找到那樣東西。」\n\n\n\n    少女繼續擺盪著身體。\n\n\n\n    我總覺得有什麼地方很奇怪，但又說不出到底是哪里奇怪。或者該說，眼前的這一切都非常奇怪，導致我根本說不出到底是哪里奇怪。\n\n\n\n    「哎……所以說……你要靠自己的雙腳去尋找啊……」\n\n\n\n    說到這裡，我才注意到了一件事情。\n\n\n\n    少女其實只有雙腳在擺盪而已。\n\n\n\n    那麼，鞦韆的繩子……\n\n\n\n    又是綁在什麼地方啊？\n\n\n\n    我抬起視線，冷不防地對上了少女的眼睛。\n\n\n\n    她是……不對，那是──\n\n\n\n    已經化為屍體的四宮學姊。\n\n\n\n    「唔哇哇哇────────！！」\n\n\n\n    石上的心臟「噗通噗通」地激烈跳動。\n\n\n\n    從額頭淌出的冷汗，滑過鼻尖滴落到了毛毯上。\n\n\n\n    ──怎麼了嗎？\n\n\n\n    是夢。石上意識到自己大概是做了個惡夢。雖然他試著回想夢境的內容，但是腦海裡只浮現出支離破碎的影像。不過最後的那個場景，果然還是深深地留在腦海之中。\n\n\n\n    「不好意思，我好像做了個不怎麼愉快的夢。」\n\n\n\n    石上環顧四周，發現自己所在的地方似乎是保健室。他不清楚現在是什麼時間。在刺眼的日光燈下，輝夜的身影清晰地投映在病床的簾子上。\n\n\n\n    ──噢？是什麼樣的夢呢？\n\n\n\n    嚴格說來，這可能是不該說給當事人聽的內容，但石上優這個人就是管不住自己的嘴巴。脖子上吊著繩子的輝夜，像是盪鞦韆一樣在樹下搖擺晃蕩……他將自己記得的部分全都說了出來。\n\n\n\n    ──這樣子啊，我死了是嗎？\n\n\n\n    石上原以為會被呵斥一頓，沒想到四宮輝夜只是冷靜地說了這麼一句。因為隔著簾子無法看到表情的關係，石上感到有些忐忑不安。平常對輝夜避之唯恐不及的石上，此刻居然無比想要見到對方的臉孔，說起來也真是相當諷刺。\n\n\n\n    石上朝著簾子伸出手去。\n\n\n\n    ──我在夢裡的模樣……\n\n\n\n    「是不是就像現在這個樣子呢？」\n\n\n\n    映入石上眼簾的，是輝夜已經化為白骨的屍體。\n\n\n\n    石上就此暴斃而亡。\n\n\n\n    死因是休克致死。\n\n\n\n    ♀♀♀\n\n\n\n    輝夜俯視著慘叫之後再次陷入昏迷的石上，忍不住咯咯地笑了起來。\n\n\n\n    「哎呀呀。」\n\n\n\n    捉弄石上是輝夜最近熱衷的活動。\n\n\n\n    她一邊反省自己有些做過頭了，一邊將骨骼標本擺回原位，隨即拍了拍石上的臉頰。石上就這樣復活了過來。"
