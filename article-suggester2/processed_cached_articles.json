  chinese_body: "〔記者邱奕欽／台北報導〕范瑋琪曾因不滿行政院長蘇貞昌禁止口罩出口，怒罵「這個狗官算是個人嗎」被網友砲轟，事隔4個多月，她偶爾在社群平台發文，酸民仍如影隨形，問她：「你小孩會知道他們的媽媽在電視上說謊說自己讀哈佛嗎？」\n范瑋琪近日在IG曬出雙胞胎兒子的日常，不料遭網友酸嗆：「你小孩會知道他們的媽媽在電視上說謊說自己讀哈佛嗎？」對此，她正面回應，無奈地說：「你呀......唉，查清楚來龍去脈再來酸我很難嗎？」\n當年范瑋琪頂著「哈佛大學經濟系」高學歷形象出道，後來被踢爆造假，去年她正式發聲明，說自己讀的是「哈佛進修學院」（Harvard’s extension school），遲了20年才澄清，被網友譏是「說謊精」。\n除了被重提虛報學歷外，也有網友翻她的口罩論舊帳：「啊你現在知道為甚麼口罩缺貨了嗎？」范范則回覆：「知道了，謝謝提醒。也知道口罩現在不缺貨了，除非有人屯貨。」"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕今年受武漢肺炎（新型冠狀病毒病，COVID-19）疫情影響，綜合所得稅結算申報延至6月底，有網友近日陸續在PTT貼出「107年度綜合所得的排名」，並指綜合所得中位數大於100萬元的村里有66名，至於綜合所得最高的則是新竹縣竹北市，連江縣東引、金門縣烏坵更分別拿下全國第2、第5，對此網友稱「新竹縣市太鬼神了」，也有網友留意到「馬祖是怎麼賺錢的？」、「東引的經濟結構有人能解惑一下嗎？」\n財政部先前公布「107年度綜合所得稅申報初步核定統計專冊」，有網友將相關資訊轉貼到PTT的不同板面，引發網友討論。資料顯示，全台每人年均綜合所得最高的「行政區」是新竹縣竹北市，每人年收入165.7萬元；第二名是新竹市東區，每人年收入157.6萬元；第三名則是台北市大安區的156.5萬元。\n至於每人年均綜合所得最多的「縣市」，則是由新竹市的130.5萬元奪冠，其次依序則是台北市125.5萬、新竹縣118.9萬、連江縣100.3萬、金門縣94.1萬等。而若以中位數來說，包含連江縣、金門縣、澎湖縣等離島居民的年收入都不低，前20名中離島就佔了6名，連江縣東引、金門縣烏坵更分別拿下全台第2、全台第5，至於台北、新竹則分別拿下7名、5名。\n針對這些數據，網友則紛紛留言表示「輪班星人又贏了」、「東引是怎麼回事？」、「馬祖是怎麼賺錢的？」、「高於全國的縣市不多」、「那瑪夏屌打一堆鄉鎮 笑死」、「整個新北能看的只有新店跟林口XD」。有曾經待過連江縣的網友則回應稱「外島薪資高我覺得3個原因：人口基數少；島上一半軍公教，領外島加給；特定產業（海帶，酒，觀光盈餘）分紅」另有一名網友則說「光是一個海帶養殖就可以帶給全島多少利潤了，還不包括其他養殖、造酒」。\n也有網友哀怨表示「萬華連全國平均都不到」、「台中薪水為什麼那麼低」、「我拉低了全國平均，真是對不起大家」、「好難過…不到中位數」、「在台北年收494萬還是算中下階層，有領薪水的奴隸，醒醒吧」。也有網友質疑為何要貼2年前的資料，對此則有網友回應「109年又還沒過完，108的綜所才申報截止，不貼107年的難道要稅務員通靈？」"

  chinese_body: "［記者洪美秀／新竹報導］新竹市人口數突破45萬人大關，市長林智堅今天親駕「幸福號」，從市府出發，把新車和摃丸送到第45萬幸運寶寶「冰冰」的家，還一起吃廠商贊助的摃丸湯，祝福小朋友長得頭好壯壯。幸運寶寶的媽媽媽范雅茹笑說，冰冰是過期寶寶，直到41週才出生，沒想到是超級幸運兒，出生就自帶房車，接到通知時還以為是詐騙，直呼「生在竹市真的太幸運了！」\n\n林智堅與進益摃丸董事長葉聰敏今天到幸運寶寶「冰冰」的家，並開起「幸福號」後座，裡面擺滿摃丸、尿布、奶瓶，讓爸媽又驚又喜。\n\n「冰冰」的媽媽范雅茹說，想生6個寶寶，因為她的媽媽就生了5個，想超越媽媽的紀錄，而「冰冰」的爸爸則開心附和說，「我們養得起啦」，讓林智堅佩服又讚賞。\n\n林智堅也細數市府的各項生育津貼和育兒津貼，並說市府一定會做新手爸媽的神隊友，更鼓勵年輕爸媽多生小孩，「只要敢生、政府就幫忙養」。\n\n市府民政處表示，第45萬幸運寶寶「冰冰」爸媽的愛情故事，是因爸爸送冰塊到媽媽工作餐廳而展開，因此第一胎寶寶取名為冰冰。\n「冰冰」爸媽都是新竹在地人，兩人都未滿30歲，媽媽范雅茹說，他們是新手爸媽，上週看到消息，還跟先生說「寶寶要當第45萬人！」去報戶口也找同樣剛得子的表弟一起去，兩人一前一後抽號碼牌，冰冰就是第45萬名，她還留著那張報戶口的叫號號碼單，說是全家的「幸運號碼」。\n范雅茹還透露，4年前曾手術取出1000公克的子宮肌瘤，原本擔心會不孕，後來順利懷孕，寶寶還很幸運拿到新車、摃丸白金卡。她立志生6胎，準備贏過媽媽生的5胎。\n民政處表示，新竹市戶籍人口在109年6月29日突破45萬大關，而第45萬人口計算方式為，當人口數到達44萬9980時，由各戶政事務所每日統計出生、死亡、遷入、遷出等人口，回報民政處人口成長數統計表。\n而人口數達44萬9999人時，改以出生人口數為計算基準，戶政事務所受理出生登記案件後，需立即印製相關資料併同出生登記申請書，回覆民政處以核定第45萬人口的產生，而「冰冰」就是這個幸運寶寶。\n民政處表示，竹市生育津第1胎補助1萬5000元、第2胎起每胎增加5000元，雙胞胎補助5萬元、三胞胎以上或第二次雙胞胎補助10萬元，另「育兒指導到府服務」提供嬰幼兒居家環境規劃諮詢、生活照顧技巧指導，從生小孩、帶小孩到教小孩都給予父母全力協助。\n如家中有0到4歲的孩子，市府每個月提供2500元育兒津貼，選擇與市府簽約的準公共化托嬰中心或托育人員，則有6000元托育補助，希望成為年輕父母在養兒育女過程中的支持與後盾。\n根據戶籍登記資料顯示，竹市人口是逐年成長的，市長林智堅上任後，已增加1萬8000多人，竹市出生率排名全國第五，自然增加率則是本島非六都縣市第一。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕今年6月台灣經歷破紀錄的高溫，加上梅雨鋒面影響台灣的時間相當短暫，6月雨量顯著偏少，而氣象局長期預報顯示，7月有偏乾的趨勢，新任氣象局長鄭明典在臉書提醒，「偏乾趨勢在強度和範圍上都有點大」。\n氣象局長鄭明典今在臉書表示，氣象局7月長期預報有偏乾的趨勢，根據美國環境預報中心的7月第二週降雨預報顯示，中國東南、中南半島、菲律賓呂宋島及台灣都有偏乾的趨勢，鄭明典表示，這代表「偏乾趨勢在強度和範圍上都有點大，表示時間尺度可能不短，需要注意！」\n鄭明典進一步解釋，通常天氣系統的水平尺度越大，時間尺度也會越長，這張圖顯示的乾區不像是區域性現象，而是水平尺度不小的現象，認為7月偏乾趨勢時間不會太短，而是否能仰賴颱風來解渴，鄭明典也指出今年「颱風季可能稍微延後開始」。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕港版國安法引發全球關注，憂心香港自由不再，但作家顏擇雅指出，除了香港，中國境內有一個趨勢需要留意，就是「加強黨建」。\n顏擇雅在臉書撰文指出，加強黨建的方式就是每個社區大樓，每個中小企業都要發展黨組織，「加強黨對城市基層的監控」。顏擇雅指出，原本中國街巷與大企業有黨組織，但現在連公寓大樓、中小企業也要有，這是源於中共5月8日印發的文件「關於加強和改進城市基層黨的建設工作的意見」。顏擇雅認為，這一趨勢下，要去中國投資、工作、念書的台灣人要更加注意言行。\n中共中央辦公廳「關於加強和改進城市基層黨的建設工作的意見」中，要求為了深入貫徹習近平新時代中國特色社會主義思想，深入貫徹黨的十九大和十九屆二中、三中全會精神，認真落實全國組織工作會議精神，切實加強黨對城市工作的領導，推動城市經濟社會發展，要加強城市基層黨建工作，對黨在城市工作的全面領導，夯實黨在城市的執政基礎，有重要意義。"

  chinese_body: "［記者陳賢義／台東報導］國軍傳近日有演訓，台東市繼昨夜有天弓三型飛彈車隊在無人戒護下行經市區，今天中午12點半左右，又有疑似軍方雄三飛彈車隊現身市區，警車開道，長達500公尺的車隊讓好奇民眾看傻眼，驚呼是要開戰了嗎？軍方低調不願多做說明。\n載著一箱箱鐵殼箱的軍車一輛接著一輛，浩大陣仗引人注目，目擊民眾驚呼猶如電影情節般，感覺就好像要開戰了，心情忍不住揪了一下。類似雷達的射控車、飛彈車、人員運輸車、救護車奔馳在市區臨海路，前方還罕見的有警車開道，車隊超過50輛，最引人側目的是10輛載著飛彈的軍卡，有軍事迷看過影像，研判可能是國產「雄三飛彈」發射車。\n1名對軍事十分著迷的退役軍官說，由軍方自產的雄三飛彈發射車，若將雄三從海上搬運上陸地，不僅可以製造射程更長的飛彈，上公路的機動性也非常強，相較固定式基地，更不容易被敵人掌握行蹤，隨時都能發起岸際攻擊。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者黃佩君／台北報導〕3倍券今首日開放預購及綁定，到下午4點已經正式破100萬達到112萬，而紙本券也後來居上、有59%民眾選擇，而41%民眾綁定數位券。實體券預購通路仍以超商居冠，共有56.6萬預購自超商，其中以統一超商、全家最多，各佔33、20萬；數位方面則仍以信用卡居冠，高達32.4萬綁定。\n3倍券自今天早上9點開始預購、綁定，1小時就突破36萬人；而到下午4點已經正式破100萬、來到112萬，紙本也後來居上，超越一開始數位搶早鳥優惠的趨勢。\n經濟部表示，到下午4點共有45.6萬人選擇數位券綁定，66.7萬人預購實體券，數位與紙本比例為41比59。其中數位券仍以優惠較多的信用卡居冠，共有32.4萬人選擇綁定；行動支付也有10.3萬；使用門檻較低的電子票證，則有2.8萬人綁定。\n而在實體券方面，4大超市仍以便利通路發威，有56.6萬人選擇超商預購，其中以統一及全家最多，分別有33萬、20萬。而網路預購則有10.1人選用。\n上路首日有不少民眾在數位券與實體券之間兩難，因數位券綁定方便、優惠也較多，但實體券也有商店等消費優惠，有不少民眾也希望實際一睹實品。\n在銀行工作的劉小姐就表示，雖然知道數位券優惠較多，但實體券可能10年才會遇到一次，仍希望拿到券來摸摸看、拍照留念。而在電商工作的林先生則說，之前就關注各個平台祭出的優惠，因此一定要選擇數位券，目前比較過後選擇了最近剛辦新卡、首刷禮上千元的外銀綁定。\n但為了鼓勵民眾多使用行動支付與加碼優惠，經濟部官員本身則多選擇數位券。\n經濟部長王美花就說，目前因公務繁忙還沒綁定，但稍晚會挑選適合的數位券方案來使用。中小企業處副處長蘇文玲則說全家都使用數位券，連較年長的父親也都會選擇使用行動支付。\n經濟部也表示，鼓勵民眾使用數位券，Gogoro特別提供25台Gogoro VIVA Lite專供使用數位券民眾抽獎，經濟部將在6號到15號天天抽出1台，之後到10月底每週抽一台。\n加上不少銀行也祭出抽獎優惠，包括台銀最大獎油電休旅車，中信銀則週週抽Nintendo Switch遊戲機、共抽出1000台等，民眾選擇數位券也可順便試試手氣。"

  chinese_body: "［記者何玉華／新北報導］去年10月宜蘭南方澳大橋發生斷橋事件，時為時代力量立委的黃國昌指負責橋梁檢測的健行科大教授陳明正團隊未落實檢測，同時揭露新北市橋梁檢測得標廠商萬鼎工程，也將檢測轉包給陳明正的萬喬豐公司，但遭到新北市政府嚴正否認，稱他「惡意栽贓、指鹿為馬」，黃國昌今在臉書發文，指他揭露的事實已經被印證，新北市政府被打臉。養工處表示，任何指控不宜在未完成行政調查前直接認定，且市府非常重視橋樑使用安全，檢測工作都持續進行中。\n據指出，市府當時針對黃國昌所指問題，後續深入進行契約相關問題了解，並2次召開採購工作及審查小組會議，均認定萬鼎公司將契約主項目交付萬喬豐公司執行，屬採購法所稱「轉包」行為；並依法公告停權3個月。不過，萬鼎不服停權裁處，已提出異議申訴。\n養工處表示，任何指控不宜在未完成行政調查前直接認定，經半年來調查檢測公司的資料，顯示有違反政府採購法，因此主動依法刊登政府採購公告；市府非常重視橋梁使用的安全，有沒有落實檢測工作是最重要的事，到目前檢測工作仍持續進行中。\n黃國昌指出，去年南方澳斷橋悲劇發生後，他不斷追查由陳明正團隊承包的橋梁檢測標案，發現新北市也有同樣問題；新北市橋梁檢測得標廠商萬鼎工程服務公司將橋梁檢測轉包給陳明正的萬喬豐公司，又再委由萬喬豐自己進行品質查證。\n黃國昌說，今年6月，公共工程委員會政府電子採購網公告，判定萬喬豐與萬鼎之間違法轉包，刊登為拒絕往來廠商，印證他揭露的違法屬實，打臉新北市政府。\n採購公報在違法廠商停權公告上指出，萬鼎公司將契約主項目交付萬喬豐公司執行，屬採購法所稱「轉包」行為；但新北市政府在去年10月9日的新聞稿中指出，健行科技大學和萬喬豐工程顧問公司都不是新北市的橋梁檢測公司，也從未和新北市政府有任何契約關係更無涉轉包，呼籲民意代表不要指鹿為馬、任意栽贓。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕港版國安法被視為該地區近百年來最嚴苛的法律，引全球輿論抨擊，有外媒統整多名中國學者的觀點，稱港版國安法類似日本上世紀初進入威權統治時代時實施的《治安維持法》，其嚴苛程度甚至超過中國本土的相關法律。\n美國《自由亞洲電台》引述清華大學政治系前講師吳強的說法指出，港版國安法與日本1925年實施的《治安維持法》類似，實際上的作用就是終結香港此前僅存的一點點自由狀態，更嚴重的是，該法案以國家安全的名義，正式將香港納入中國國安體制中，其嚴厲程度比中國本土有過之而無不及。\n吳強進一步指出，港版國安法中詳列顛覆國家政權等4大罪行及其刑度，各大罪行的最高刑罰均為無期徒刑，實際上就是為求撲滅香港的社會運動，他總結道，「該法案消滅了香港最後一絲殘存的自由，且格外針對港民主運動」。\n此外，該法案第38條效力無限擴大至全球範圍一事也受到各界抨擊，中國法界認為，外國人士聲援香港或議論港政治內容涉該法條規定的罪行，竟也可被認定違法，「比此前預測的內容還要悲觀」。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者林曉雲／台北報導〕大學指考將從明天開始連考3天，4萬3753名考生應試，再創史上新低，明天首日考物理、化學及生物，第2天考數學乙、國文、英文及數學甲，第3天考歷史、地理、公民與社會。大考中心提醒，除常規的量體溫、手部消毒外，試場人數從原先42人降為36人，考生須全程戴口罩，違者該科最重零分，且不開放家長陪考，另今年新增規定需持「入場識別證」才能入校。\n今年受到武漢肺炎（新型冠狀病毒病，COVID-19）疫情影響，108學年第2學期延後開學，連帶影響大學指定科目考試（指考）的日程，從原先7月1、2、3日，改為7月3、4、5日。考試科目包括國文、英文、數學甲、數學乙、歷史、地理、公民與社會、物理、化學、生物等10科，考生可自由選考。選考科目不得少於3科，但已報考 109學年度大學術科考試者，不得少於2科，各科考試時間均為80分鐘。\n大考中心提醒考生應遵守規定，各節考試開始前5分鐘預備鈴響時才可入場；考試開始鈴響前，不得翻閱試題本，並不得書寫、畫記、作答；考試開始 20 分鐘後不得入場，除因生病或特殊原因經監試人員同意外，入場後至考試開始60分鐘內不得離場。\n有鑑於國中會考出現考生不戴好口罩爭議，大考中心說明，基於防疫考量，指考考生須全面配戴口罩，無口罩不得入場應試，也要遮好口鼻，若故意違規且屢勸不聽將登記，最重該科以零分計，口罩則由教育部提供；因天氣炎熱，今年指考將全面開放冷氣，試場人數從原先42人降為36人，避免群聚也提升冷房效果，關門但開室內對角的兩扇窗戶各15公分來通風。\n另外，各試場考區將採單一出入口，因取消准考證多年，今年為防疫則新增防偽的入場識別證，考生須持識別證才能入校，各科考試前也會檢查，身分查驗則要準備有效證件（有照片的身分證、駕照、健保卡等）。\n大考中心在指考前已與中央流行疫情指揮中心勾稽，主動通知居家檢疫、隔離的考生參加補考，補考日期在7月20到22日。大學招聯會表示，補考生未來參加考試分發入學，將採外加名額，不影響一般生權益，但受政府名額控管的科系，如醫學系、牙醫系、中醫系、公費師培生等，沒有補考名額。\n109學年大學個人申請共5萬2321人獲分發，報名分發率達6成，創10年新高，缺額也僅4197名，創8年新低，大學端不排除是今年防疫不能出國，優秀學生留在國內升學影響，因此回流至考試分發的名額也減少，使考試分發入學競爭激烈。預計7月17日公布成績及寄發成績通知單。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕武漢肺炎（新型冠狀病毒病，COVID-19）疫情肆虐全球，許多產業都遭受重創，法國政府稱新聞媒體業也遭受重擊，國會為此投票通過，只要民眾新訂閱新聞報章雜誌就可抵稅，最高達50歐元（約新台幣1650元）。\n綜合外媒報導，法國國會議員投票通過，針對首次訂閱「提供一般性或政治性質新聞」的報紙、雜誌或線上新聞的民眾將給予抵稅優惠，只要訂閱至少12個月就可抵稅最高達50歐元（約新台幣1650元）。\n報導指出，武漢肺炎疫情重創全球產業，各地的報紙出版商也不例外，隨著發行和紙本銷售受到阻礙，廣告收入下降，許多人都被迫休假，報業也面臨歇業危機，有些更在這波疫情中直接收攤，甚至傳出美國的報業正面臨滅絕危機。除了法國採取抵稅的措施，加拿大也考慮要將數位新聞訂閱的稅收抵免從15%提升到50%，希望藉此鼓勵更多民眾支持媒體。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者邱書昱／新北報導〕新北市中和區連城路段正在興建捷運樹林萬大線，上下班車流量大，工程更導致塞車嚴重，對此中和區公所開闢中和大排西側連城路至中正路間河側的道路，除了打通外也增加路寬，更提供華中橋至雙和醫院的醫療緊急動線，今天舉行啟用典禮，完工順利打通南北向的「任督二脈」。\n中和區長賴俊達表示，中和大排兩側道路是當地南北往來的大動脈，但是大排西側道路、連城路至中正路段，因為公有地遭民宅占用導致寬度不夠，只能行人通行，經常使往南車輛必須繞行兩次90度大轉彎、等待2個紅綠燈，反而造成該路段打結。\n然而，中正路行駛至大排道路無法右轉，往北需要繞道而行加重周邊交通負擔。\n中和區公所工務課長陳亦揚表示，由於原本路幅不寬，工程設計理念除了思考如何加寬路面改善車流外，也要建設人本休閒空間，打造水岸環境，因此以L懸臂方式向河面拓寬人行道2公尺，並建立無障礙系統，順利完成路寬2.8至3.4公尺的單行道。\n附近居民表示，道路打通後確實救災、救護能更方便，旁邊靠近大排處也有新設菱形護欄跟人行道路，提高安全性。\n陳亦揚補充，這次的工程的道路雖然僅有309公尺，卻是交通要道，工程經費為2500萬元，並由新北市新建工程處全額補助。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕美國聯邦參議院上月25日通過「香港自治法案」（Hong Kong Autonomy Act）後，聯邦眾議院1日一致通過相關法案，內容幾乎與參議院相同，將強化美國政府制裁違反1989年「《中英聯合聲明》及香港《基本法》的個人和企業的能力，並授權制裁協助這些個人和企業進行大額轉帳的金融機構。\n綜合媒體報導，該法案在眾議院一致通過，反映出華盛頓對中國頒布香港新國家安全法的擔憂。根據國會規定，該法案必須退回參議院並通過，然後再送交白宮，總統川普將決定簽署法案或否決。\n該法案由聯邦眾院外交委員會亞太小組共和黨籍副主席約霍（Ted Yoho）與民主黨籍小組議員薛曼共同提出，要求對違反中國在《中英聯合聲明》中所負義務的個人及金融機構實施制裁。\n眾議院議長裴洛西（Nancy Pelosi）1日在眾院外委會表示，港版國安法對香港人民是殘酷的，實施全面的鎮壓行動，破壞中國承諾的自由保障，港版國安法也象徵著「一國兩制」已死。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者蘇福男／高雄報導〕為配合台商回流政策，活化高雄市商業區土地，台糖公司將釋出28.65公頃用地，供有意投資業者規劃開發，7月3日、15日下午2點將在台糖高雄物流園區國際會議廳各舉辦一場招商說明會。\n台糖表示，此次釋出的28.65公頃用地，包括少康營區9.53公頃商業區土地、國泰重劃區8.68公頃、金銀島購物中心原址3.37公頃、亞洲新灣區港埠商業區4.32公頃及特貿7D2.65公頃、7E0.1公頃土地。\n　台糖少康營區位於小港區、高雄國際機場南側，占地9.53公頃，原為國軍陸戰隊99守備旅營區，2012年12月歸還台糖後，變更都市計畫，高雄市政府辦理第89期（原少康營區）市地重劃，無償取得10公頃公園用地、2.42公頃道路用地及1.3公頃商業區抵費地，台糖則取得9.53公頃商業區。\n　台糖說明，10公頃公園用地開闢完成後，將命名為「小港區森林公園」，少康營區開發案具有緊臨大型公園和機場景觀優勢，商業區可作規劃開發賣場、國際商旅、醫療觀光服務等用途，提供當地招商引資、發展經濟，未來發展引人注目。\n　另國泰自辦重劃區位於鳳山區，鄰近鳳山西捷運站、國道一號中正交流道，周邊有衛武營國家藝術文化中心、衛武營都會公園，平假日遊客人潮多，鳳山區整體缺乏大型商場、購物、百貨、休閒遊憩活動場域。\n　國泰市地重劃分配，台糖預計可分得約8.68公頃商業區，其中，純商業使用的「商二」土地面積達6.3公頃，其區位條件佳，宜做大型商業設施如商場、購物中心、量販店等，開發後可望成為鳳山區最大型商業設施。\n　亞洲新灣區總開發面積580多公頃，涵蓋苓雅、前鎮、鹽埕及鼓山區等港灣地段，其中，台糖港埠商業區緊鄰最熱門的文青聖地駁二藝術特區和高雄流行音樂中心，範圍涵蓋大義倉庫區、綠地和停車場，此次提出綠地、停車場區域，佔地4.32公頃；另特貿7D面積2.65公頃，特貿7E面積0.1公頃，皆位於成功二路旁，臨接夢時代購物廣場，三宗基地均位處商業熱點，交通便捷。\n　至於位於前鎮區的金銀島購物中心，在2015年3月結束營業後，業者將建物無償移轉給台糖公司，其基地面積3.37公頃，北側為凱旋青年觀光夜市和205兵工廠原址，鄰近輕軌凱旋瑞田站及捷運紅線凱旋站，交通可及性高，位處精華地帶，台糖將採房地出租方式，期許廠商進駐活絡地方經濟。\n　台糖表示，7月3日、15日下午2點將在台糖高雄物流園區國際會議廳各舉辦一場「高雄少康營區、國泰重劃區、亞洲新灣區商業用地暨金銀島購物中心招商說明會」，希望透過招商說明會，與各界投資商面對面交流，收集各方建議、市場需求與投資意願，更期盼能吸引廠商投資，線上報名網址http://bit.ly/2uJ6vAJ。"
