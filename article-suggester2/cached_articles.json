  chinese_body: "在台灣一所小公寓內，40歲的穆吉（Muji）在晚上8點左右完成她這一天的最後一項工作，將一名患有腦退化和帕金森症（Parkinson』s disease，帕金遜症）的婦人長者扶上牀。她要為這位長者做一切的事情，包括幫她合上眼。之後，她會坐在那裏撫她的頭髮，直到她入睡。這之後是她從清晨到現在第一次有了自己獨處的時間，她開始晚禱。\n這是印尼一部新製作的紀錄片《助守在異鄉》（Help is on the way）當中令人難忘的一幕。它講述的是像穆吉這樣在台灣的印尼外傭的故事。\n穆吉是安娜（Ana）的全職照顧者。她悉心凖備安娜的膳食，並且餵她吃。「我把她當成是我自己的母親，我就用同樣的態度來對待她，」她向BBC表示。\n就像很多在台灣的外籍傭工一樣，穆吉將她兩個年幼的小孩留在家鄉，來這裏掙取比在印尼做夢都掙不到的高薪水。\n「我丈夫有外遇之後，我要自己獨力照顧孩子，就接了這份工作。我是個窮人——如果我不出國工作，我就養不起我的小孩。我父母是農民，我沒有其他選擇，只能丟下孩子，」她說。\n這部影片觸及了勞工權益、規則含糊的招聘機制以及有關移民、階層和性別身份等等議題。\n「我們希望這部影片引出關於移民勞工和他們家庭的故事。讓人們去考慮他們的工作狀況、獲取有品質服務的能力，以及讓移民勞工更好地了解安全的移民做法，」製片人尼克·卡爾帕克迪安（Nick Calpakdjian）解釋說。\n紀錄片講的是印尼的故事，也是台灣的故事。\n「我希望它能成為一座連通兩國觀念的橋樑，印尼和台灣，僱主和僱員。因為如果這個橋樑不存在的話，就會像我們彼此不認識一樣，」導演伊斯邁爾·法赫米·盧比斯（Ismail Fahmi Lubis）說。\n26歲的蘇克瑪和21歲的默麗各自的家庭都將所有的希望放在出國掙錢的她們身上。於是，她們在西爪哇省南安由縣的一家招聘中介花了1500美元，給她們提供三個月的培訓，包括清潔、護理工作，以及初級的普通話，並且幫她們在海外找到工作。\n她們被培養，被各種拉扯成為符合條件的樣子。她們要測體重，以符合台灣的標凖——護理工最多只能扶背體重比她們重五公斤的人，而且她們還會被反覆警告，不要逃走，不能懷孕。\n這些女性顯然背負著重擔，知道她們的收入可能讓一家人脫離貧困，但同時又意識到，這可能需要她們付出巨大的個人代價。\n有一幕是蘇克瑪在鏡頭前崩潰落淚。她回憶起過去在馬來西亞工作的出國經歷，她在那裏被告知不能在房子裏祈禱，想要離開卻又不能。不過，她很堅決地要去台灣，掙夠錢來讓父母能夠去麥加。\n中介機構對於他們的運作是不透明的，而且影片中還暗示，印尼和台灣兩地都從移民勞工這裏獲取財政利益。有一幕，穆吉的中介公開地和她的僱主、安娜的女兒凱瑟琳（Catherine）討論，要將她換掉有多容易。「印尼人比較聽話，」中介笑著說，彷彿他們沒把穆吉看在眼裏。\n穆吉說，她現在和凱瑟琳的關係很好，但是一開始一度是很難相處的，穆吉還想過離開。\n穆吉的日常工作很艱巨，從清晨工作到很晚，而且在台灣法律之下，家庭傭工沒有權利要求任何加班費。\n即便如此，我們還是看到她有一些寶貴的時間，去地下商場和其他印尼傭工進行社交，吃印尼菜。\n影片還觸及了台灣如何有機會成為其中一些女性爭取權益的地方。\n35歲的塔麗在台灣西南部一家護理院裏做護士，她在那裏的基本薪水是每月750美元，比家庭傭工要多。\n「我們的主要目標是工作……但是在台灣，還有很多事情是我們有可能做到的，取決於我們怎樣把握自己，」她在影片裏說。\n她很年輕就因為懷孕而要結婚，她說這一點令她的家人很失望，但是在台灣，她能夠在一家社區大學裏學習傳播學，希望這能夠讓家人驕傲。\n「我記得我的父親說，你的知識會讓你更受尊重，而不是你的財富，」她說。\n她會一直呆到半夜，室友都睡著之後，她還在寫小說，並且發表在台灣的印尼語媒體上。\n塔麗說，她希望這部影片「能夠啟發很多人，因為有很多移民勞工在海外表現出眾，為國家和民族爭光」。\n在說到和僱主凱瑟琳一起看這部影片時，穆吉緊張地笑了。\n「我看的時候是悲傷和快樂交集。我覺得自豪，想到我有多想念孩子和離開他們有多痛苦，我又覺得傷心，」她說。現在，她已經離家三年。\n但是，在更廣泛的意義上，她希望電影會幫助減小對移民勞工的偏見。\n「一些印尼人看不起我們，覺得我們是想找一個外國男人，或者不想負家庭的責任。但是在電影裏，你能夠看到，我們在國外真的很努力工作，不是他們想象的那樣。」\n「我希望老闆們從一開始就尊重我們，如果有些事情我們不知道，就給我們一點耐心。有些老闆還會試圖性騷擾我們。我們是人——尊重我們，」她說。\n一起看電影的時候，凱瑟琳哭了，並且擁抱了穆吉。\n為了營造這樣的互動和引出這些對話，幕後的團隊先是做了一個倡議，邀請人們在社交媒體上分享他們作為家庭傭工的經歷。\n製片人尼克·卡爾帕克迪安開始反思自己。\n「我很快就了解到，如果我要安心讓一個人照顧我的小孩，那我就不能只是把她們看作是『僕人』，」他說。\n「僱主和僱員的關係是一直在的，但是這並一定要主導我們營造出來的人性互動。」\n穆吉正打算續三年約。在這之後，她說就想短暫休息一下，花點時間和她的孩子在一起，然後再出國工作。\n「孩子們仍然需要我打工，」她坦白地說。\n她希望讓他們有多一些選擇。\n「我不希望他們走我的路。我希望他們能在印尼找到好工作，不用像我一樣漂在外面，遠離家人。你打電話聊天是不一樣，我很牽掛他們，」她說。\n*《助守在異鄉》（Help is on the way）可在印尼地區的Go Play、GoJek等串流服務上點播，亦在台灣公共電視台PTS上播放。"

  chinese_body: "雖然全球處在新型冠狀病毒疫情全球大流行之下，但是作為藏傳佛教精神領袖，達賴喇嘛仍然認為世界要有樂觀的理由。他接受BBC記者賈斯汀·羅拉特（Justin Rowlatt）訪問時表示，如果地球上70億人能夠形成一個「共同的認知」，他們甚至還有可能聯合起來解決氣候變化的問題。\n第一次見到達賴喇嘛的時候，他捏了我的臉頰。\n有人捏你臉頰已經是不太常見的了，更何況是一個被很多追隨者看作是活佛的人。但是，達賴喇嘛是一個調皮的人，喜歡跟採訪者鬧。\n當然，現在這樣一個勢態是不可能的了——我們的最近一次對話是通過視頻會議應用程式進行的。\n達賴喇嘛很快就出現了，坐在鏡頭前，微笑著調整他那件深紅色的長袍。\n「五點半，」他咧開嘴笑說。他雙眼亮了起來：「太早了。」我們都笑了，他又在逗我。\n這位西藏精神領袖同意接受訪問時，我很高興，但當他的秘書告訴我，將會是印度時間早上9點時，我有一點點失落。\n那是英國時間凌晨4點30分，就是說我要3點30分到達辦公室。\n製作這段採訪的詹姆斯·布萊恩特（James Bryant）幫了我一把。\n「雖然對我們來說沒有什麼是不可能的，但是這次真的非同一般，」他寫道。\n達賴尊者的秘書很客氣地同意了將訪問改到印度時間10點。\n於是，在上星期三的5點，我已經在BBC的倫敦辦公室，看著從印度達蘭薩拉傳過來的視頻訊號。\n兩邊的反差簡直再明顯不過。\n我坐在一排排空無一人的辦公桌中間，灰暗的燈光只亮了一半；而在喜馬拉雅山腳下一個宮殿裏，身披紫色和藏紅色長袍的僧侶走來走去，在一個鍍金色的房間裏調整著線路和攝像機。\n山上明亮的陽光透過窗戶穿了進來。在一個有冰雪山景的宮殿裏度過疫情封鎖的時光是再好不過，達賴喇嘛也承認這一點。\n「我們這裏有非常純淨的水和新鮮空氣，我在這裏過得很平靜，」他告訴我說，一邊再次擺出他招牌式的大笑。\n他同情那些在這次嚴重的大流行疫情中受苦和擔驚受怕的人們，但是他說，還有很多事情具有啟發性，而且值得慶幸。\n「很多人不顧自己的安危，去幫助別人，這非常好。」\n然後達賴喇嘛笑了。「當我們面對著一些悲慘的狀況時，同情心這種更深的人性價值就展現出來了。」\n我問他，對於那些擔心和害怕的人們有什麼建議。他說，重要的是，試著不要擔心太多。\n「如果有辦法去克服你的狀況，那要努力，無需要擔心，」他解釋說。\n「如果真的沒有辦法解決，那擔心也沒用，你什麼也做不了。你只有去接受它，就像人會老一樣。」\n再過幾個星期，達賴喇嘛就85歲了。\n「去想我太老了，老人沒用了，這樣沒有意義，」他接著說。\n「年輕人身體壯，他們的頭腦是鮮活的，他們能夠為創造一個更美好的世界作貢獻，但是他們又太過激動，」他笑說。\n「年長的人更有經驗，他們能夠幫助教育年輕人。我們可以叫他們冷靜，」他說著又大笑起來。\n他相信，年輕人將會是在最前線，去解決他現在其中一個最迫切的擔憂：解決環境問題。\n他說，他已經在他的有生之年看到了氣候變化的影響。他回憶起自己年輕的時候，似乎頗為激動。\n第十四世達賴喇嘛生於1935年西藏的高原上一條偏遠的村落。\n他在1937年被認定為第十三世達賴喇嘛的「祖古」，即轉世靈童。\n「我在西藏的時候，」他告訴我說，「我對於環境沒有認識。我們將它看作是理所當然，當時我們可以在任何一處水流喝水。」\n直到他去了印度，以及之後開始周遊世界時，他才意識到，世界已經受到了怎樣的破壞？\n「我在1960年來到達蘭薩拉這裏。那個冬天下了很多雪，之後是一年比一年少。」\n「我們必須認真地對待全球暖化，」這位藏傳佛教領袖說。\n他敦促世界，在風力和太陽能上做更多的投資，漸漸擺脫對化石燃料的依賴。\n他告訴我說，重要的是我們要認識到，我們不是單一的個體，我們要依賴我們所在的群體。\n「無論你的家庭多麼富有，沒有了社群，你是無法生存的，」他說。\n「在過去，人們過份強調了我的那塊大陸、我的國家、我的宗教。現在這種想法已經過時，現在我們真的需要70億人類有一種同一性。」\n他說，這可能是從這次新型冠狀病毒危機裏得出的其中一件積極的事情。\n但是，他指出，世界很快就從這次病毒的威脅下覺醒過來，但是全球暖化是一個更有威脅的隱患，它是在「一個個十年」中到來。\n這或許看起來沒那麼迫切，而他擔心，我們可能很快就會發現，它已經超出我們的控制。\n這場挑戰也與達賴喇嘛另一項重大的事業有關：教育。\n「全世界應該更加關注如何轉化我們的情緒，」他對我說。\n「它應該屬於教育的一部分，而不是宗教。教育頭腦的平靜，教育如何得到頭腦的平靜。這是非常重要的。」\n然後，就到了這個訪問當中最難的部分。我想要談論達賴喇嘛自己的死亡——或者更凖確地說，是關於他的轉世問題。\n這不僅是他自己的事情。他死後會發生什麼，將是關乎整個藏傳佛教以及西藏解放運動的關鍵。\n中國軍隊在1950年進駐西藏，宣稱對這個地區行使主權。\n很多藏人極力反對這個他們看作是非法侵佔的統治。\n作為西藏人精神領袖，達賴喇嘛一直是這場反抗的標誌性人物。\n他提醒了我，他過去曾經說過，他的死亡很可能標誌著達賴喇嘛轉世這一偉大傳統的終結——「達賴喇嘛」這個字眼在藏語隱含著「偉大的上師」之義。\n「它可能會隨著這一個喇嘛尊者而終結，」他一邊笑，一邊指自己的胸口對我說。\n他說，西藏和蒙古的喜馬拉雅佛教僧人將會決定下一步如何。\n他們會決定，第十四世達賴喇嘛是否已經轉世成下一位靈童。\n這可能將是一個艱難的過程。被現在這位達賴喇嘛確定為藏傳佛教第二號人物班禪喇嘛的男孩，已在1995年被劫持。通常尋找達賴喇嘛下一位轉世靈童的事務，是由班禪喇嘛領導的。\n達賴喇嘛表示，他的追隨者如何決定，對他而言已經不是問題。\n「我自己是沒有興趣了，」他笑著說。\n他的希望是，他生命的最後一天到來時，他仍然保有自己的好名聲，並且能感覺到自己為人類作出過貢獻。\n「然後，就結束，」他再一次笑說。\n就這樣，我們的訪問也結束了。"

  chinese_body: "美國加州州長辦公室發佈了一條短片，傳遍社交媒體，吸引了三百多萬人觀看，或許你就是觀眾之一。在這個視頻中，喜劇演員拉里·大衛（Larry David）以他標誌性的嘲諷風格呼籲人們聽從官方的建議，呆在家裏，以阻止新冠病毒的傳播。\n他說：你們這些「白癡」怎麼搞的，可以整天躺在椅子上煲電視劇，這樣好的機會你們竟然想放棄！\n我們已經習慣了勸我們去做其實我們並不想做之事的所謂健康指南，比如多運動鍛煉，每天吃五份、八份甚至十份水果和蔬菜之類。但這一次，官方的建議聽起來很容易做到，只是要你呆在家裏，躺在沙發上，看電視而已。人性本有好逸惡勞之一面，這個建議似乎很能投人性之所好。\n事實上，幾周的居家避疫後，你可能已經發現事情沒那麼簡單。原來，我們人類的生理設計並不是讓我們習慣於懶惰，盡可能少做事。確是如此，我們人類是因為營營役役才能繁衍興旺，或者至少在勞動忙碌和能夠休息之間有一個很好的平衡。\n當然，這也是事實，我們經常會做棄難求易的選擇，比如困難最小的路途，及成功的捷徑等。如果你有遙控器，為什麼要起身親自去轉換電視的頻道？如果你有汽車，為什麼要騎自行車去超市？如果你可以比同事少做一半的工作，那何樂而不為？\n任何形式的工作或努力都會讓我們精神和肉體受到壓力，所以盡可能避免是有道理的。有時候我們就是這麼做的。有時這被稱為省力法則或齊夫定律（Zipf law）。你可能認為沒有人會試圖打破這個定律，實際上我們是經常違背這個法則。\n你曾經夢想過自己可以無所事事嗎？在吊牀上懶懶地躺一個下午。只是盯著天花板，耳中寂靜無聲。這個主意聽起來可能很美妙，但事實上，我們發現除了睡眠之外，完全的無所事事是很難做到的。\n幾年前在弗吉尼亞大學進行的一項著名的研究中，每次只帶一個參與實驗者進入一個空無一物的房間，所有可干擾人思緒的東西全部移除。身處這個房間，參與者沒有電話，沒有書，沒有視頻，也不允許打瞌睡。在參與者的腳踝上接上電極後，就讓他們獨自留在房間中15分鐘。這本是一個休息片刻的機會。\n但結果如何？把參與者獨自留在房間之前，研究人員向他們展示如何按下一個連接到一台機器上的電腦鍵，按這個電腦鍵會對參與者產生電擊。你可能會認為，任何參與者只要嘗試一次電擊的劇痛後，就不會再試第二次。\n錯了。事實上，71%的男性和25%的女性在隔離於這個房間的時候至少電擊了自己一次，其中一名男性甚至電擊了自己190次。事實證明，無事可做是非常痛苦的，以至於許多參與者寧願折磨自己，也不願忍受無所事事。\n這個實驗是一個極端的例子。但是我們從日常生活所知，人們總是選擇去做他們不需要做的事情，而且有時是痛苦的事情。想想你那些跑馬拉松或者在健身房辛苦鍛煉的朋友，他們所做的已遠遠超出了健康和健身的需要。還有那些辛苦跋涉穿過冰原到達地球兩極或航海環遊世界的自討苦吃者？\n多倫多大學的邁克‧因斯里奇（Michael Inzlicht）稱這是努力悖論，因為作出努力是有代價的，但同時也帶來價值。有時我們選擇簡單易行的路線，盡可能少做一些事情，但在另一些時候，如果我們必須付出相當大的努力，我們會更加珍惜努力之所得。\n努力的內在樂趣給了我們如此多的快樂，以至於我們不會選擇捷徑。我們可能會花幾個小時在一個神秘的縱橫字謎上冥思苦想，而不是使用搜索引擎來尋找解決方案。\n我們在年幼的時候就已知這個道理。當我們還是孩子的時候，我們通過經驗和說服知道了辛苦努力會帶來價值，隨著年歲漸長，深明此理，因此我們會享受辛苦努力本身。這就是所謂後天的學而得來的勤奮。20多年前，我作背包旅行時，遊覽了印度尼西亞弗洛雷斯島會變色的克里穆圖火山湖。這三座火山湖每隔幾年就會改變顏色，因此成為神秘而壯觀的自然美景。\n不過，這次克里穆圖火山湖之行，之所以至今記憶猶新，至少部分原因是我及同行者為此行所付出的艱辛。我們坐了好幾天的船和公共汽車，其中一程是好幾個小時的小貨車，一路上風很大，顛簸得很厲害，我們暈車嘔吐，於是僱了一個人分發嘔吐袋，然後收集起來扔到車門外。\n隨後，我們在一家悶熱惡臭的旅館度過了一晚，旅館牀墊凹凸不平，還隨處可見蟑螂。凌晨4點，我們又坐上了另一輛小巴，開始前往湖區的最後一程。我們備嘗辛苦才到達克里穆圖火山湖，而這些勞碌奔波就是我們整個克里穆圖火山湖之旅的一部分。\n離觀景區不遠是一個直升機停機坪，有錢的遊客大概就是坐直升機在那裏降落。但我們並不羨慕他們。他們能像我們那樣深切地感受欣賞克里穆圖火山湖嗎？可能不會。\n今天世界上許多高山的頂峰可以乘坐纜車車廂或纜車吊椅登頂。但當然，登山者寧願冒著刺骨寒風和凍傷的危險在光禿禿的半山岩石上睡露營帳篷過夜，也不願走舒適的旅遊路線。行為經濟學家喬治‧洛溫斯坦（George Loewenstein）引用英國探險家喬治‧馬洛里（George Mallory）的一句名言，將他探討這種現象的論文命名為「因為山就在那裏」。\n喬治‧馬洛里1924年在攀登聖母峰時遇難。他這句名言常為登山者引用。喬治‧洛溫斯坦解釋說，人類無法抗拒去實現某個目標及克服各種困難的機會，即或他們並不需要這樣做。\n即使你本人未必能感受登山運動員從登山的辛勞和危險中獲得的興奮感，但我們大多數人也會認同「宜家效應」，即人們發現，對自己動手做的家居用品會更加珍惜。\n所有這一切都意味著，當我們待在家裏，自我隔離的時候，躺在沙發上看電視只是我們打發時間的一部分。我們可能認為幾個星期的悠閒生活很有趣，但事實上最後會讓我們心煩意亂。除非我們是生病或身體需要休息，否則強迫性及時間過長的休息，不會使我們感到放鬆，反而會使我們感到焦躁不安。我們需要找到方法，在居家隔離期間盡可能地複製我們在日常生活中達到的最佳狀態的勞逸節奏和平衡。\n所以，鍛煉身體，給自己設定任務，做一些費力且困難的事情是很重要的。我們都應該尋找能夠推動心理學家米哈利‧塞克斯仁米哈伊（Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi）在其著作《心流：最佳體驗的心理學》中所說的心流之活動或體驗。能推動心流的任務，比如繪畫、園藝或做拼圖，是如此的吸引人，以至於我們非常投入，會忘記時間，也不再為其他事而煩惱。\n在正常時期，我們大多數人對休息不夠重視。因此，在這段特殊的時期，我們應該抓住機會，如果我們可以的話，多多休息，並能夠把更為平衡的勞逸節奏帶入我們居家隔離結束後的生活。但是在這個困難的時期，我們會發現我們人類不是天性懶惰的生物。的確，我們可能是以一種奇怪的方式發現，原來我們要想勞動得少，休息得多，竟然需要作出相當大的努力才辦得到。\n--\n克勞迪婭‧漢默德是《休息的藝術：現代生活中的喘息之道》一書的作者。"

  chinese_body: "中國遊客最愛去的英國購物景點，比斯特購物村（Bicester Village）在剛解封恢復營業之後就湧進大量人潮，當地居民發起請願要求關閉購物村。\n社交媒體上的照片顯示，專賣名牌高檔設計名品的比斯特購物村人潮擁擠不堪，根本沒辦法保持安全社交距離。\n已經有超過3000多人簽署請願書，要求關閉比斯特購物村。\n英國各類零售商店從本周開始解封營業，但必須維持嚴格的安全措施，包括每個人保持2米的安全社交距離，限制進入店內人數等。\n發起請願的維克斯（Laura Wicks）表示，成百上千人擠進比斯特購物村，就好像新冠病毒疫情從來沒發生過一樣，讓她感覺非常厭惡。\n集中160家商店的比斯特購物村在網站上表示，所有顧客在抵達時都要經過體溫掃描檢測，遊客還必須維持兩米安全社交距離。\n一名購物遊客亞當（Adam Galbraith）表示，購物村各家商店都有維持店內的人數管制，所以在商店裏面維持兩米安全社交距離不是問題，但是在商店外面就「沒人管了」。\n他對BBC說：「這裏真的太擁擠了，絶對沒辦法保持社交距離。」\n「像這樣規模的購物村他們應該知道，要讓人與人之間維持兩米距離，最多能讓多少人進來購物村，我覺得在這一點上面他們完全沒有控制。」\n亞當表示，如果管理單位能限制進入購物村的人數，限制每個人兩小時購物時間，那麼情況就會好很多。\n有一些商店推出手機程序，讓顧客利用手機程序排隊，而不需要站在店門外面排隊，相比之下，這些商店門口的人潮就比較少。\n另一名購物遊客阿馬拉辛格（Tesh Amarasinghe）表示，她進入購物村的時候經過體溫掃描，商店裏的安全距離也維持得很好，但在商店外購物村的街道上，就很難維持兩米的安全社交距離。\n阿馬拉辛格是一名家庭醫生，她表示，如果在商店外面和其他人擠在一起排隊一個小時才能進去的話，那麼在商店裏面維持兩米的社交距離又有什麼意義？"

  chinese_body: "希臘的聖托裏尼和米克諾斯島6月15日解除旅遊禁令，敞開大門歡迎世界各地的遊客，就像新冠疫情令全世界漸次封關隔離之前那樣。\n但這個夏天不少歐洲國家仍在密切觀察疫情動向，在放鬆隔離方面謹慎有加。英國人目前即使可以出國旅行，回國後也面臨14天隔離。英國民眾眼下能做的基本上就是神遊，神遊往年最愛的那些度假勝地。畢竟，要不是新冠，全家老小已經在凖備出發度假了。\n那麼英國人往年最喜歡的有哪些度假勝地呢？\n西班牙\n因為氣候的關係，英國夏天很短，氣溫也不高，全年日照時間少，所以到了夏天，英國人喜歡去有陽光的熱帶島嶼和海邊度假。\n說到度假、陽光、熱帶、島嶼和海灘，英國人首先想到的就是西班牙；西班牙幾乎是所有英國人最愛的旅遊目的地。\n西班牙離英國不遠，文化相近，物價較便宜，最重要的是，氣候「保證」要比英國好，因此成為許多英國家庭度假的首選，有些英國人乾脆在西班牙買房作為第二個家。\n西班牙度假的類型也非常多元化，有海島沙灘，也有觀光城市，滿足各個年齡，不同愛好的人的需求。\n地中海的伊維薩島（Ibiza）和馬略卡島（Mallorca）就以瘋狂派對、喝酒、舞廳夜總會聞名，非常受到年輕人的歡迎。\n非洲西海岸外的西班牙屬地加那利群島（Canary Islands）一年四季氣候溫和，也是英國最受歡迎的旅遊地之一，尤其是全家大小一起度假。\n更不用說那些充滿文化氣息的西班牙城市了，隨便到馬德里、巴塞羅那和其他城鎮，都可以感受到西班牙的文化、藝術、歷史、美食、風景。\n總之，對那些想要出國度假的英國人來說，西班牙是一個「很保險」的選擇，西班牙保證會帶給你太陽、沙灘、美酒和塔帕斯（tapas）下酒菜，夜生活和數不盡的觀光景點。\n希臘\n希臘也是另一個以海島度假著稱的地方，愛琴海、愛奧尼亞海（Ionian Sea）、地中海三面包圍，希臘一共有超過200多個有人定居的島嶼。\n和西班牙一樣，到希臘度假也是享受陽光、島嶼和沙灘，同時還可以探索雅典和其他地方上千年的歷史、遺跡和神話故事。\n希臘那麼多的島嶼也有不同的風光，例如東邊的島嶼靠近土耳其，你可以感受到明顯不同的中東風情，南邊的最大島嶼克里特，得益於非洲來的暖風。\n而愛琴海中的米克諾斯島（Mykonos）和聖托里尼島（Santorini），你可以欣賞白色牆壁和藍色屋頂的希臘海島建築。\n法國\n法國是距離英國最接近的歐洲大陸國家，雖然英國人和法國人並不總是相處得來，但是法式風情在英國一直有市場。\n法國有山有海，有美食也有美酒，喜歡觀光和藝術文化的人可以到巴黎這樣的大城市，帶孩子的家庭可以到巴黎迪士尼樂園，喜歡自然和戶外活動的人可以到阿爾卑斯山區來一趟自行車旅行或徒步健行，到普羅旺斯和蔚藍海岸更可以欣賞山村田園風光和尼斯、嘎納等迷人的海濱城鎮。\n由於地理位置接近，許多英國人一家大小從家裏直接開車去法國度假，連車帶人乘渡輪或火車跨越英法海峽到歐洲大陸。\n開著自家的車在法國度假不論去哪裏都多了一份便利，也省了度假期間租車的花費，回程的時候還可以在加萊港口購買歐洲貨和法國酒帶回英國享用，而這也成為開車到法國度假一定要做的事情之一。\n葡萄牙\n葡萄牙也是吸引英國人夏天度假的熱門地點之一，尤其是最南端的阿爾加維（Algarve）地區，還有里斯本，波爾圖等地方。\n南邊的阿爾加維地區以美麗的海岸著稱，這裏面臨大西洋，夏天時比地中海度假地要稍微涼爽一些，而且觀光客相對較少一點，可以享受更多一點的悠閒時光。\n阿爾加維美麗懾人的海灘是最大的吸引點，一共有超過150多個海灘供你選擇，有些地點僻靜脫離塵世，有些適合衝浪，還有些地點可以同時看到石灰岩峭壁，湛藍色的海水和黃金沙灘。\n靠近海岸線附近還有幾個小鎮，你可以明顯感受到當地人的悠閒生活，度假者在路邊咖啡廳，酒吧和餐館消磨時光，廣場上還有水池，噴泉讓孩子玩耍。\n意大利\n想去地中海度假，而且預算比較寬裕的英國人可以選擇意大利，這裏的套裝旅遊行程比較少，價格稍微高一點。\n意大利的撒丁島和西西里島上有許多高檔度假酒店，很多酒店還有自己的專屬沙灘，滿足社交名流維護隱私的需求。\n在地中海島嶼或濱海小鎮上還可以看到許多私人豪華遊艇，停泊在離岸海域，簡直就是有錢人的海上城堡，船上的富豪和名流可以在不受打擾的情況下充分享受度假時光。\n不去海島的英國人可以選擇到阿瑪菲海岸（Amalfi Coast），體驗意大利湛藍色的地中海和海岸山城的絶色美景。\n馬耳他\n位於意大利南邊的馬耳他是一個地中海島國，以前曾經是英國殖民地，因此英國人對馬耳他情有獨鍾。\n英國女王伊麗莎白二世結婚後和丈夫愛丁堡公爵曾經在馬耳他居住兩年，當時她尚未繼承王位，而愛丁堡公爵則擔任海軍軍官被派駐在馬耳他。\n當時的伊麗莎白公主尚未繼承王位，和夫婿派駐海外，得以度過兩年安靜的悠閒時光，後來女王也多次提到她對馬耳他的喜愛。\n英國人來到馬耳他度假，可以享受地中海的溫暖氣候和海灘，但又感覺置身在英國，有許多英國商店，而且當地人也說英語，這是其他南歐國家沒有的。\n土耳其、塞浦路斯\n英國人要去地中海度假，再遠一點的就去土耳其或塞浦路斯，這裏的套裝旅遊行程選擇多，價格也比較便宜，但飛行時間稍微長一點。\n除此之外，土耳其的海邊度假勝地，以及塞浦路斯，都給英國度假客提供了陽光、海灘和美酒。\n加勒比海\n在英國的度假旅遊廣告上，加勒比海島嶼經常被形容成人間天堂，幾個關鍵詞是：熱帶島嶼，沙灘，珊瑚礁，私人度假別墅。\n幾個較受英國人歡迎的島嶼包括安提瓜、巴巴多斯、多米尼加，還有牙買加、古巴、巴哈馬。\n英國富豪企業家理查德·布蘭森就在加勒比海擁有一個私人的度假島嶼Necker Island，這裏經常有社交名流和好萊塢明星前來度假。\n今年，英國的威廉王子就和全家人到了馬斯蒂克島（Mustique）度假，馬斯蒂克島是一座私人島嶼，屬於聖文森特和格林納丁斯。\n這座與世隔絶的小島擁有清澈見底的藍色海水，白色沙灘，最重要的是絶對的隱私程度，島上是禁飛區，全島只有100棟度假別墅，王室成員到這裏度假不必擔心狗仔隊和粉絲的跟蹤。\n美國佛羅里達州\n從加勒比海再過去一點就到了美國的陽光之州——佛羅里達州，這裏也是英國人喜愛的度假勝地之一。\n佛羅里達州的奧蘭多被稱為主題樂園之都，有迪士尼樂園，還有環球影城，哈利·波特魔法世界，是有孩子的英國家庭的最愛。\n往南一點就到了邁阿密，在充滿拉丁風味的邁阿密，有各種水上活動，還可以看到時髦的男女，各類商店，酒吧和餐館，晚上的夜生活也多彩多姿。\n."

  chinese_body: "22歲的霍莉（非真實姓名）在小學和中學時候就對黑人同學說過種族歧視的言語，那時候她以為那麼做「只是好玩而且很酷」。\n就算被她辱罵的人告訴她的行為是不對的，霍莉依然繼續如此。\n美國黑人佛洛依德之死及其引起的大規模示威抗議活動，讓像霍莉這樣的一些年輕人反省自己過去的種族歧視行為，並思考如何彌補所造成的錯誤。\n霍莉表示：「我為我小時候的種族主義行為道歉。」\n「我做錯了」\n霍莉認為影響她行為的原因之一是她成長的家庭和所交的朋友。\n「我上的學校大部分都是白人學生，我周圍沒有多少其他種族背景的人。」\n霍莉交的朋友也有類似的種族主義行為，霍莉自然「有樣學樣」。\n霍莉說，她家人的種族主義看法也影響了她的觀念，但是她不推卸責任，說到底她必須為自己的行為負責。\n喬（非真實姓名）認為，他成長的環境影響了他在學校的行為。\n「我不覺得我的家裏充滿仇恨，但我在家裏絶對聽過侮辱黑人的言辭。」\n隨著他漸漸長大，他開始模仿哥哥說一些種族主義的言語。「現在回想我說的那些東西真的很不好。」\n喬也有「棕色皮膚的朋友」，但他還是隨便亂說侮辱黑人的語言，他聽的音樂裏也有這些字，當時他根本不覺得哪裏有錯。\n「我根本沒意識到我周圍的人有何感受，因為我說了一些種族歧視性的語言，我還失去了一個朋友，當時我根本沒在意。」\n文化差異\n反對種族主義的活動人士歐文·瓊斯（Owen Jones）表示，理解不同文化是消除種族主義的關鍵。\n「如果每個人都能了解種族主義的背景，與販賣奴隸的歷史，那麼他們就能夠理解那些言語有多麼傷人。」\n他說，「我們需要的是對不同文化的理解和認識，從基本的教育開始做起。 」\n改變態度\n霍莉後來加入了一個教會，改變了自己的社交圈，有了更多的黑人朋友，這才改變了她從小到大的態度。\n喬一直沒有覺得自己的種族主義傾向，一直到5年前他接觸到「微歧視」（microaggression）這個名詞才恍然大悟。\n「微歧視」指的是在細微到幾乎難以察覺，充斥著毫無根據的臆斷、雙關語式的隱晦表達以及對異己者或不合心意者不加區別地盲目排斥。\n認錯道歉\n霍莉和喬都因為最近的反抗種族歧視運動而開始反省自身過錯。\n霍莉表示，她為過去的行為而道歉，現在她嘗試進行自我教育，了解更多的黑人歷史。\n喬也表示，示威抗議活動讓他想要為自己給他人造成的痛苦做出彌補。\n歐文表示，要消除種族主義必須從小做起，讓孩子走出「文化泡泡」，從小開始接觸各種種族背景的人。\n「沒有與生俱來的種族主義，種族主義是後天成長環境造成的。」 "

  chinese_body: "幾個世紀以來，夢境一直吸引著哲學家和藝術家。夢中場景被認為是神聖的信息，也是激發創造力的一種方式。19世紀出現的精神分析方法，是理解我們潛意識的關鍵。最近幾周，我們許多人都經歷過異常生動的夢境，現在似乎是幾個世紀以來探索對夢境的描繪和理解的最佳時機。此過程中，我們甚至可能發現一些與自己經歷有趣的相似之處。\n為什麼我們現在的夢境如此生動？佩里說：「我們處在一個新的環境中，因此需要處理新的情緒。」她解釋說，我們編故事來理解夢中那些「並非直接地，而是通過隱喻」表現出來的情感。\n阿爾布雷希特·杜勒 (Albrecht Durer)的《夢的視覺》(Dream Vision, 1525)，是西方藝術中已知的第一次對藝術家個人夢境的描繪。這幅水彩畫似乎是夢醒後匆忙創作的，畫中顯示一股洪水從天而降，吞沒了作者。「我醒來時四肢都在發抖，過了很長時間才恢復過來，」作者說。\n佩里說，儘管她所接受的訓練告訴她根本沒有所謂的「解夢字典」，但幾十年的實踐表明，「夢中的特定物體通常有特別的含義。如果有人夢到水，那是關於感覺的。」這聽起來就像是杜勒「沉浸在感情中」，儘管佩里不能確定這些感情是什麼，「我們大多數人都害怕被湮滅和遺忘，不管我們承認與否，或者在醒著的時候根本感覺不到，」她說。\n佩里在推特上描述的很多夢都是關於被水吞沒的人，這也許並不奇怪，儘管這位夢見自己在海嘯中衝浪的女人顯然比杜勒更能處理自己的情緒。\n然而，杜勒的個人作品是極少數。雖然文藝復興激發了人們用古代哲學研究夢的興趣，但這必須與當時盛行的基督教意識形態相一致，後者不贊成異教的解釋。大多數夢的繪畫本質上是聖經的。 \n《雅各之夢》，以及《約瑟夫為法老王解夢》，主題都大受歡迎。拉斐爾（Raphael）在1518年把它們畫在梵蒂岡的阿波斯托裏克宮（Palazzo Apostolico）的天花板上。夢的生動隱喻表現在漂浮於空中的球形天花板上，彷彿在強調他們的理解超越了凡人。 \n然而，神話主題，如洛倫佐·洛托（Lorenzo Lotto）的《沉睡的阿波羅》（Sleeping Apollo）和《名噪遐邇的繆斯》(Muses with Fame ，1549)，可以讓藝術家們提出夢和靈感之間的關係。阿波羅的睡眠似乎讓繆斯們可以隨心所欲地脫掉衣服，在附近的草地上一絲不掛地嬉戲，這表明睡眠可以釋放出無拘無束的創造力。 \n波希(Hieronymus Bosch)作品中噩夢般的內容引起了更多人的共鳴。幾乎可以肯定的是，他們的意象不僅被理解為藝術家對天堂和地獄之火的描繪，而且還被理解為一種警告，懲罰可能會降臨在罪人身上，他們如果不懺悔，等待他們的將是什麼。這一點在《通代爾的幻象》（The Vision of Tundale，1520-30年)中表現得很明顯。此幅畫作由波希（Bosch）的一個追隨者完成，畫中罪惡的騎士盤旋在他自己的噩夢般的地獄之上。\n作為藝術主題的夢在啟蒙運動的理性時代基本失寵，但在18世紀晚期，亨利·富塞利（Henry Fuseli）創作了最著名的畫作之一——《夢魘》(The Nightmare ，1781)。在文學、聖經或藝術史上都沒有類似作品的情況下，儘管有人認為它預示了弗洛伊德（Sigmund Freud）的精神分析理論，但仍然無法解釋此幅畫作。\n佩里並不認為這幅畫直接描繪了夜間的恐怖。相反，她看到了女人毫無防備的姿勢，馬對她胯部的邪惡興趣，還有精靈的姿勢，好像他要在她身上大便——這是「許多男人常作的與女人相關的墮落濕夢」。或者，她補充道，「一個女人……我們的夢想和性幻想很少政治正確的，無論我們是什麼性別。」\n「把你的夢境畫出來」\n正是象徵主義者將夢境重新帶回了藝術表達的最前沿。對於古斯塔夫·莫羅(Gustave Moreau)和奧德隆·雷登(Odilon Redon)等藝術家來說，夢是一種破解現實和存在之謎的方法。雷登的《眼睛》(The Eye ，1882)中，一隻眼睛形狀的熱氣球似乎在把一個人的頭抬到雲裏，這暗示了不協調的夢境意象。毫無疑問，這場運動對超現實主義者產生了影響。\n超現實主義的主要靈感來源於弗洛伊德的《夢的解析》。根據弗洛伊德的理論，夢是一種願望實現的表達，被自我審查扭曲成想象，做夢者醒來時毫無意義。他相信，通過解開隱藏的意義，精神分析可以治癒任何折磨人的疾病。\n然而，弗洛伊德認為夢需要破譯才有治癒效果，而超現實主義者則認為夢是一種釋放不受約束的創造性表達慾望的手段，是對歐洲資產階級文化的一種反抗。他們在第一次世界大戰之後開始厭惡這種文化。\n在超現實主義藝術中，夢者通常不會被描繪出來。相反，觀眾直接面對的是夢的內在機理。在喬治•德•基裏科（Giorgio de Chirico）充滿焦慮的夢境或馬克斯•恩斯特（Max Ernst）奇特的繪畫作品中，夢境以謎題形式出現，挑戰著觀者對現實的感知。\n不得不說，弗洛伊德被藝術家的想法弄糊塗了，儘管他在1938年遇到薩爾瓦多·達利（Salvador Dalí）時確實稍微改變了他的論調。達利帶來了他的畫作《水仙變形記》(Metamorphosis of Narcissus ，1937年)，畫中水仙狀物體凝視著水池，一隻手指和拇指抓著一個裂開的蛋，蛋裏出現了一朵水仙花。在此之前，弗洛伊德認為超現實主義是「絶對的(比如說95%，像酒精一樣)，古怪的」；但是達利，以他「不可否認的嫻熟技術」使弗洛伊德重新考慮自己的觀點。 \n2017年，佩里製作了BBC第四頻道的紀錄片《菲利帕·佩里帶你成為超現實主義者》(How to be a Surrealist with Philippa Perry)，她自己也探索了實現夢想的超現實主義方法，成立了一個超現實主義研究所，讓公眾在畫之前告訴她自己的夢想。「當人們重溫自己的夢想時，他們從中得到的東西是如此令人感動，」她說。 \n對於病人，佩里通常採用德國精神病學家弗裏茨·珀爾斯(Fritz Perls)首創的格式塔療法（Gestalt therapy），即從夢中所有物體的角度，向自己複述夢境。你夢中的一切都是你的一部分，所以你知道他們會說什麼，從而更好地了解你自己。 \n在我們目前的情況下，佩里認為多種方法都有好處。「把你的夢境畫出來，寫下來。所有這些都能幫助你處理夢境中的情緒和感覺。你獲得了所有權，因此你獲得了控制權，」她說。\n而且，誰知道呢，在這個過程中，我們可能會釋放出自己迄今未知的創造力。\n訪問BBC Culture閲讀英文原文"

  chinese_body: "德國民調機構Dalia Research最新公布的2020民主認知指數（Democracy Perception Index）報告，圍繞今年上半年席捲全球的新冠病毒疫情，從53個國家的12萬多人搜集了民眾對各國抗疫決策與政府民主程度的看法。\n報告對美國的全球民主領導力、中國與美國的抗疫誰更成功、哪些國家對政府抗疫行動最為滿意等諸多問題提供了答案。 \nDalia 2013年在德國柏林創辦，此次與民主國家聯盟（The Alliance of Democracies）共同撰寫的第三份全球民主認知年度民調報告，被稱為世界上最大規模的民主研究報告。\n英國《衛報》認為，這份報告在本周四有美國國務卿蓬佩奧出席的哥本哈根民主峰會之前發佈，「透露了對美國全球（民主）領導力極深的不滿」。\n中國與美國抗疫對比\n本次民調的第11和第12個問題分別就美國和中國應對新冠病毒疫情表示看法。\n美國和日本的受訪者認為美國比中國做得更好，台灣與韓國的受訪者認為美國與中國應對疫情差別不大，另外40多個國家的受訪者都認為中國勝過美國。\nDalia Research在報告中寫道：「幾乎所有國家都表示中國對新冠病毒的反應比美國做得更好。」\n民調報告中，中國受訪者認為中國抗疫做得好的達95%，認為美國做得好的只有11%。  而美國受訪者53%認為美國做得好，認為中國抗疫工作好的只有40%。\n新冠肺炎疫情爆發使得原本有所緩和的中美關係更加緊張，中美在今年年初為貿易戰簽署的第一階段協議所營造的合作氣氛，在肺炎疫情的衝擊下蕩然無存。\n美國總統特朗普和國務卿蓬佩奧多次公開指責中國政府沒有及時公開透明地向國際社會傳遞新冠病毒的信息，延誤了世界特別是美國對疫情做出及時反應。\n美國方面還批評中國散佈有關疫情的虛假信息。而中國包括外交部發言人在內的政府官員，則批評美國自身抗疫不利，指責中國純屬「甩鍋」，是為了推卸責任。\n各國民眾對政府抗疫的評價\n在這53個國家所做的民調發現，超過一半受訪民眾認為自己國家政府的隔離措施「恰如其分」，大約三成民眾認為「做得不夠」，約兩成認為政府措施「過度」\n亞洲地區對政府的滿意度最高，其中中國和越南受訪者的滿意程度最高，馬來西亞、台灣、韓國、新加坡民眾對政府抗疫都有超過70%的滿意度。\n而對政府抗疫行動最為不滿的受訪者在南美洲的巴西和智利，這兩個國家接近六成的受訪者認為政府沒有採取足夠的措施隔離抗疫。\n認為政府隔離措施「過度」的受訪者主要集中在中東地區國家，如沙特、摩洛哥和埃及。\n美國對全球民主的影響力\n世界各國對美國在全球民主的影響力問題上仍然有明顯的分歧，44%的受訪者認為美國發揮了正面影響力，38%的受訪者認為美國的影響力「負面」。\n其中對美國全球民主影響力持最負面態度的國家是中國的受訪者。2020年，47%的中國受訪者認為美國的全球民主影響力是負面的，遠遠超過了2019年的5%。這顯示中美兩國關係緊張情況下，中國民眾對美國民主影響力的看法出現很大的變化。\n值得注意的是，中國以外對美國全球民主影響力持負面看法的國家很多是美國的盟友，它們包括：德國、奧地利、丹麥、愛爾蘭、比利時、瑞典、希臘、法國、加拿大、英國、西班牙、瑞士、澳大利亞、意大利，俄羅斯等。\n而在美國國內這一指數在2020年也較2019年下跌了11%。\n民主認知赤字\n這份民主認知指數報告還總結了受訪者對自己國家民主的滿意程度。2020年的指數顯示，沒有任何一個國家的受訪者認為民主現狀達到了他們的期望值，也就是說，民主現狀與民主期望之間仍然有距離，顯示所有國家都存在民主認知赤字。\n不過，赤字越小說明政府越大程度地滿足了民眾的民主期望。2020年，民主赤字最小的政府是台灣，其次是菲律賓、瑞士、丹麥、沙特、韓國、越南。\n值得一提的是，中國受訪者的民主認知赤字比絶大多數國家都要小，遠遠低於日本、新加坡和香港以及美國、英國等西方民主工業國家。\n而民主認知赤字最大的國家包括委內瑞拉、波蘭、匈牙利、烏克蘭和泰國等。\n哥本哈根民主峰會\n本周四（6月18日）將在哥本哈根舉行為期兩天的民主峰會，受疫情的影響峰會將用虛擬遠程方式舉行。\n參加者包括台灣總統蔡英文、香港眾志秘書長黃之峰、美國現任國務卿蓬佩奧、前國務卿奧爾布賴特和克里、澳大利亞前總理特恩布爾，北約副秘書長米爾恰·傑瓦納等。\nDalia公司將在哥本哈根民主峰會上呈交這份民主認知指數報告的全文。\n英國《衛報》報道稱，在中國和美國進入更加明確的意識形態對抗之際，這次的峰會很有可能成為支持民主活動人士的集結點。"

  chinese_body: "俄羅斯法庭日前以間諜罪判處美國前海軍陸戰隊隊員保羅•韋蘭（Paul Whelan）16年監禁，美國媒體報道說這是總統普京扣押美國人質的報復行動。\n一直有揣測說，俄羅斯此舉可能導致兩國間人員交換，即用被定罪的美國人交換多年前美國從第三國引渡到美國並監禁的兩名俄羅斯人。\n《華盛頓郵報》周二的報道稱，這是俄羅斯進行的人質報復行動。俄羅斯和美國一直有交換被對方逮捕人員的歷史，冷戰時期的被交換的著名人員有U-２偵察機駕駛員鮑爾斯，冷戰後的有兩年前在英國成為毒殺目標的俄羅斯雙面間諜斯克里帕爾。\n2018年年底加拿大按美國的引渡要求逮捕了中國華為公司的高管孟晚舟，隨後中國以間諜罪指控逮捕了兩名加拿大人。加拿大也曾指中國在進行人質報復行動。\n18個月前被捕\n美國前海軍陸戰隊隊員保羅•韋蘭18個月前在莫斯科的旅館房間被捕。他受到間諜罪指控，俄羅斯法庭對其處以16年刑期。\n50歲的保羅•韋蘭同時有加拿大，愛爾蘭，美國和英國4個國家的國籍。周一上午法庭裁決後，保羅•韋蘭馬上聲明說要提出上訴。\n美國駐俄國大使約翰•沙利文（John Sullivan）在法庭外說，「美國要求立即釋放美國公民保羅•韋蘭。對他的判決是當著全世界的面對正義進行嘲弄。」\n俄羅斯外交部副部長謝爾蓋•裏亞布科夫（Sergey Ryabkov）周一通過俄羅斯新聞社表示，莫斯科可能對囚徒交換協議持開放態度。他說，「我們一再建議有關方案，即讓在俄羅斯服刑的美國公民與（在美國）受到過分和非法指控的俄羅斯公民進行交換」，「我沒有理由對下一步發生什麼進行揣測，這種建議已經多次向美國提起。」\n但約翰•沙利文說，美國的目標不是進行人員交換，而是為保羅•韋蘭尋求「正義」。\n美國廣播公司的報道引述美國情報官員的話說，韋蘭的履歷並不像一個情報人員。\n美國人在俄羅斯被誘捕\n2018年12月，保羅•韋蘭在俄羅斯首都的五星級的大都會酒店內被捕，之前他從一個俄羅斯聯邦安全局的特工那裏接過一個USB裝置。檢察官說，電腦閃存裏面有俄羅斯情報機關成員的相關信息。保羅•韋蘭的辯護律師說，他被俄羅斯方面誘捕。\n他的辯護律師說，保羅•韋蘭認為他得到的閃存裏面是一些他和一名俄羅斯男子一起舉辦的活動的照片，而不是秘密材料。他把那名俄羅斯男子當朋友。 \n報道說，保羅•韋蘭從2000年中期開始頻繁去俄羅斯。在他被捕前幾年，俄羅斯安全部門就開始注意他，他們認為他可能是個情報威脅。  \n從一開始，保羅•韋蘭的孿生兄弟就否認他同間諜活動有關係，說他不過是喜歡旅行，他去莫斯科是為了參加一個婚禮。\n保羅•韋蘭在類似臉書（Facebook）的俄羅斯社交網站VKontakte上面設有一個賬戶。根據美國廣播公司的報道，在2019年1月他的帳戶上有55個「好友」，幾乎全是年輕男子，其中大部分人的帳戶上都顯示同軍隊有某些聯繫。\n美國引渡兩名俄羅斯人\n保羅•韋蘭的律師提到的可能成為被交換的人選是目前在美國監獄服刑的俄羅斯人維克多•布特（Viktor Bout）和康斯坦丁•雅羅斯申科（Konstantin Yaroshenko）。\n布特2008年在美國特工在泰國進行的誘捕行動中被捕，俄羅斯認為他是「政治犯」。他被從泰國引渡到美國，俄羅斯和美國就此進行過外交爭奪。\n2010年泰國高等法院裁決，允許他被引渡到美國。他被控向被美國認定的外國恐怖組織出售軍火，定罪後被判了25年監禁。根據當時路透社的報道，布特認為自己是美國懲罰性訴訟的受害者。\n俄羅斯飛行員雅羅斯申科2010年在利比里亞被捕後，被帶到美國受到圖謀運輸毒品的指控，並被判監禁20年。俄羅斯外交部說他在那裏遭綁架後被帶到美國。雅羅斯申科本人否認自己有罪。\n俄羅斯媒體多次做過雅羅斯申科在美國獄中條件惡劣做過報道。在新冠疫情爆發期間，塔斯社最近報道說，雅羅斯申科出現乾咳，但在監獄內得不到合格的醫療。\n《莫斯科時報》周一（6月15日）報道中引述韋蘭的律師說，有罪判決在預料之中，自從韋蘭被捕後，各方就沒有隱瞞所謂的交換計劃，即用韋蘭換回在美國被監禁的俄羅斯公民。他說聽說過交換的建議，但不清楚是否換回布特還是換回雅羅斯申科，或者用韋蘭換回兩個人。\n保羅•韋蘭在美國的孿生兄弟戴韋發表聲明說，韋蘭的家人希望在判決後俄羅斯和美國「開始討論立即釋放保羅的問題」。\n對於美國通過長臂管轄在海外逮捕俄羅斯公民，俄羅斯曾通過立法有針對性地懲罰美國的具體官員。2013年俄羅斯通過的所謂關塔那摩法案，宣佈把參與了上述兩名俄羅斯人被捕和審判的美國法官，調查人員和司法官員，特工加入制裁名單，禁止這些人進入俄羅斯。"

  chinese_body: "美國女子凱瑟琳·蘇利文（也稱凱西·沙利文，Kathy Sullivan）1984年作為太空行走的第一位女性已經被載入史冊。\n但她最近又完成了另一項偉大壯舉：成為造訪地球最深海溝的第一名女子。\n現年68歲的蘇利文上周（6月7日）下潛到距離海面11公里的太平洋馬里亞納海溝最深處，成為上天入海第一人，再創歷史。\n她是如何做到的？\n蘇利文在接受BBC記者凱麗-利•庫柏（Kelly-Leigh Cooper）的採訪時表示，自己從小就充滿好奇心，並且喜歡冒險。\n她興趣廣泛，不是人們所相像的一般小女孩那樣。\n成長足跡\n蘇利文1951年生於美國的新澤西州，但她的童年是在加州度過的。\n她父親是一位航空航天工程師，父母總是鼓勵兩個孩子自由思考並參與討論。\n蘇利文說，父母總會滿足他們的求知慾和好奇心，是兄妹二人最好的朋友。\n當蘇利文和哥哥5、6歲時，她哥哥就已經表示自己長大要開飛機。而蘇利文則開始對地圖著迷。\n還很小時，蘇利文就開始如饑似渴地看書、讀報。她對一切探索學科有興趣。\n雖然當時的海洋探險家以及宇航員等領域統統被男性所壟斷，但它並沒有讓蘇利文感到畏懼。\n蘇利文感興趣的是這些人的探險世界、經歷和知識。\n她解釋說，自己當時的志向絶非是想做何種職業或是獲得什麼頭銜，而是嚮往那種能夠結合冒險、知識和能力為一體的經歷和體驗。\n蘇利文本科學的是地球科學(earth science)。\n當時在70年代，這一學科領域幾乎被男性所壟斷。但蘇利文並未感到因為自己是女性而受到過欺辱和騷擾。\n隨後，蘇利文開始攻讀海洋學。\n進入太空\n為了進一步了解地球知識，探索宇宙奧秘，蘇利文申請了美國國家航空航天局（NASA)的工作。\n蘇利文說，如果成功入選自己將能從太空軌道親眼觀測地球。\n1978年蘇利文成功入選Nasa, 並於1983年首次進入太空。\n1984年10月11日，蘇利文成為首位在太空行走的女性，創造了歷史。\n她當時乘坐的STS-41-G是第十三次執行航天飛機任務，也是挑戰者號航天飛機（the Space Shuttle Challenger）的第六次太空飛行。\n她後來繼續參加了另外兩個航天任務，其中包括1990年發射的哈勃太空望遠鏡。\n在離開NASA後，蘇利文在美國科學管理界擔任過許多要職，其中包括出任美國國家海洋與大氣管理局（NOAA）的首席科學家以及在奧巴馬執政期間擔任該局局長等。\n大多數人能夠創造一次歷史已經很了不起，但蘇利文卻再創歷史輝煌。\n海底探索\n不久前，她收到美國前海軍軍官、海洋投資探險家維克多·維斯科沃（Victor Vescovo）的邀請，邀她一起探險目前已知的海洋最深處：挑戰者深淵（Challenger Deep）。\n馬里亞納海溝位處太平洋，為全球海洋的最深處。海溝底部稱為「挑戰者深淵」，水深約10925米，在關島西南200英里處。\n蘇利文說，她收到維克多的電子郵件，信中說現在是女性探索最深海底的「真正時刻」了。\n6月7日蘇利文和維克多一起乘坐兩人深海潛水器成功抵達「挑戰者深淵」。\n蘇利文也成為探訪這一最深海底的第八人，同時也是第一個抵達海洋最深處的女性。\n1960年，瑞士海洋學家皮卡（ Jacques Piccard ）和美國探險家沃爾什（Don Walsh） 成為人類首次下潛到「挑戰者深淵」的人。\n蘇利文形容這次海底旅行如此神奇和魔幻，整個過程歷時4-5個小時。\n永無止境\n蘇利文相信不論是國家還是個人，都應該繼續擴大我們對這個世界的認知和探索。\n她還表示希望在科學、技術、工程和數學（Stem）領域中提高多樣性和女性數量。\n蘇利文說，科技並不是整天坐在實驗室裏和數字及程式打交道的乏味工作。科技完全可以成為創意性的工作。\n成為上天入海第一人之後，蘇利文下一步有何探險計劃呢？\n蘇利文表示，探險的形式可以有多種多樣。它並非總意味著你要親身上天入地。\n還有許多學科和主題等待人們的開發和探索。\n蘇利文說：「我想我會一直探索下去，直到行將就木那天為止。」"

  chinese_body: "中國足壇一代名將郝海東在「六四」31週年紀念日當天，在海外社交媒體上發表宣言，猛烈抨擊中共、宣稱要建立「新中國聯邦」。事發後不久，他與妻子葉釗穎彷彿一夜之間便從中國的互聯網世界消失了。\n如果在搜索引擎百度和社交媒體微博上，搜索「郝海東」3個字，展現在眼前的都只是沒有找到相關結果的提示。郝海東曾在1998年獲得「中國足球先生」稱號，而如今，他在這一稱號的名單中也消失了。\n他的妻子，羽毛球名將葉釗穎曾被視為中國羽壇一姐，曾獲世界羽毛球錦標賽女單冠軍，但她的名字也在中國的社交媒體和搜索引擎上杳無結果。\n中國高效信息管控\n很多觀察人士都注意到，在中國近年來所實行的日益嚴厲的信息管控制度下，像郝海東一樣突然「消失」的名人其實還有很多。他們大多在觸碰了某條政治紅線後，便突然消失在了中國構築的互聯網高牆內。\n一位熟悉中國信息管控體系的學者對BBC表示，網絡實名制讓中國互聯網信息的管控更加有效，如果被當局加入黑名單，「只要用實名註冊的賬號都會被封號，一切發聲的渠道就都掐住了。」\n「『紅線』一直是不清楚的，沒有規定告訴你什麼話能說，什麼話不能說，」這位學者說。「這本身就是一種恐嚇的作用。」\n除了郝海東外，還有哪些曾廣為人知的名人在中國互聯網上遭到「除名」？\n任志強\n因發表大膽政治言論而遭到封殺，另一個典型例子莫過於現年69歲的中國的地產大亨任志強。\n任志強本是一名中共高幹子弟，他曾任北京華遠地產股份有限公司的董事長，並與現任中國國家副主席王岐山關係密切。他在中國互聯網上一直保持著犀利敢言的風格，曾多次就樓市政策發表觀點，被網友稱為「任大炮」，擁有近4000萬微博粉絲。\n2016年，他在個人微博上對領導人習近平的「官媒姓黨」政策提出批評，質疑稱「政府啥時候改黨政府了？花的是黨費嗎？」他認為，中國的新聞媒體應該為人民服務，而不是為黨服務。\n他的此番言論遭到多家中國官方媒體的駁斥，北京官媒「千龍網」發表題為《誰給了任志強反黨的底氣》的文章，怒斥其「一個連黨章都能無視的黨員，公然反黨的底氣何來？」他的社交媒體賬號隨後遭到刪除，並被處以「留黨察看」一年的懲罰。他隨後淡出輿論視野，開始木工創作。\n然而，在今年新冠疫情爆發後，任志強撰寫一篇措辭嚴厲的長文批評中國政府應對疫情不力，並稱習近平是一位渴望權力的「小丑」，這使他遭到當局的第二次打壓。\n4月7日，北京西城區紀委發佈通告稱，任志強「涉嫌嚴重違紀違法」，目前正在接受當局的紀律審查和監察調查。他從此與外界失去聯繫。\n阿丘\n因新冠疫情中的言論遭到封殺的，還有中國中央電視台的前主持人阿丘。\n52歲的阿丘原名邱孟煌，在中國官方電視台擔任新聞評論和社會類節目的主持人近20年，包括央視新聞頻道節目《社會記錄》等。\n今年2月20日，中國新冠疫情正處於高峰，中國當局亦面臨國際社會越來越大的關於其初期掩蓋疫情的質疑聲浪，民族主義情緒高漲。阿丘在微博的一條帖子中稱，「我們可不可以說話語調稍溫和並帶些歉意，不慫也不豪橫地把口罩戴起來，向世界鞠個躬，說聲：對不起，給你們添亂了。」\n他的這條微博立即引發網友不滿，儘管他不久後便刪除了該微博，但仍遭到部分網民的謾罵與攻擊。很多網友指其為國外的反華勢力「遞刀子」。\n他擁有超過442萬粉絲的微博在幾天后遭到屏蔽，頁面變成一片空白。中國媒體還引述央視總編室知情人士的消息，稱其「已被徹底封殺」。\n李志\n消失在中國互聯網上的名人，還有41歲的中國獨立音樂人李志。\n李志是中國當代最著名的民謠歌手之一。他在2004年推出首張個人專輯《被禁忌的遊戲》，到目前一共發行9張專輯。他在2018年發佈的一張單價人民幣18元（2.5美元）的新數字專輯，在兩小時內就在全渠道賣出2萬張。\n然而，去年4月起，包括他的微博賬號、微信公眾號在內的眾多社交媒體賬戶都突然被關閉。在中國音樂流媒體平台QQ音樂和網易雲音樂上，也均查不到有關「李志」的任何信息。\n和此前被屏蔽的名人經歷類似，中國官方並未對此舉給出任何解釋，但有分析指李志的遭遇可能與他帶有敏感政治色彩的歌曲有關。\n此前，李志的歌曲曾多次因觸及政治敏感話題而遭到封禁，比如反映「六四」事件的《廣場》、《他們》、《1990年春天》，以及諷刺專制的《人民不需要自由》等，而2019年正是「六四」事件30週年。\n李志在過去的演唱中，時常展現了他對現實和公共事件的思考，個人演出也經常伴隨有批判意味的即興詩歌和即興演講，外界猜測這或許讓當局感到不滿。2017年，李志在跨年演唱會上朗誦了中國詩人北島的批判詩《回答》，而配樂正是他的作品《廣場》。\n在全網下架之前，李志還曾策劃在中國334個城市進行巡演的「叄叄肆計劃」，但當年2月在四川的巡演卻突然取消。儘管李志方面當時表示是由於身體原因，但四川省文化和旅遊廳後來發佈通告，稱其叫停了「某行為不端知名聲樂演員」的個人巡演活動，仍被外界猜測指向李志。\n咪蒙\n咪蒙曾是中國社交媒體上頂級的流量紅人，43歲的她擁有1600多萬粉絲。她的行文犀利潑辣，並帶有負能量的自嘲風格，一些批評者將其稱為販賣焦慮的「毒雞湯」。\n她常使用一些大膽和頗具爭議性的標題來吸引眼球，例如《職場不相信眼淚，要哭回家哭》、《聽說你是個備胎啊，我也是》。這些頗具情緒操控能力的文章讓她的廣告收入不菲，她曾吹噓給自己的實習生月薪5萬人民幣（7070美元）。\n然而，她的折戟之作是旗下賬號的一篇名為《一個出身寒門的狀元之死》的文章。這篇2019年1月發佈的文章講述了一個寒門之子逆襲成為高考狀元，最終又被厄運擊倒患病身亡的故事，文章的閲讀量在一天之內超過10萬。但隨後有不少讀者指出文章存在漏洞，質疑文章內容造假。\n咪蒙隨後道歉，並宣佈停更她的微信賬號2個月，但人們很快發現她的賬號在所有平台上下架。網絡平台「今日頭條」發佈封禁公告，指控她的賬號存在「污文化、喪文化，販賣焦慮、騙取流量」的行為。\n很多中國媒體對此也拍手叫好。「澎湃新聞」發表社論說，「別了！咪蒙！毒雞湯終於涼了」。《新京報》則在評論中稱，「那些畸形的自媒體商業模式、煽動民粹的生意經，早晚都會進行不下去。」\n方舟子\n曾是中國知名科普作家的方舟子早年因「網絡打假」而走紅於中國社交媒體，但一直我行我素的他也同樣遭到封殺。\n52歲的方舟子曾是一名科研人員，擁有生物化學博士學位，但他更熱衷於在互聯網上進行學術「打假」，揭露學術腐敗和簡歷造假的現象。被他質疑者眾多，包括韓寒、李開復和被譽為「打工皇帝」的企業家唐駿等。因為「打假」引發的爭議，他曾在2010年8月在北京住所附近遭到襲擊受傷。\n在2014年10月，方舟子在中國多個互聯網平台的帳號突然被關閉，包括他從2004年開通的長達10年的博客。他隨後在推特上稱，全網封殺的原因是由於其揭露了一名「網絡作家代表」。\n這名「網絡作家代表」被認為是四川網絡作者周小平。周小平寫過《夢碎美利堅》、《他們的夢想和我們的旗幟》等文章，在當年被「欽點」參加了習近平主持的文藝工作座談會，被官方媒體吹捧成唱響主旋律的草根網絡作家。\n然而，方舟子在社交平台上對周小平的文章進行了批駁，逐條指出其中的失實之處，這似乎讓中國當局感到顏面盡失，他的社交媒體賬號很快被統一屏蔽。\n在方舟子被「封殺」後一天，官方媒體人民網和新華網分別發文力挺周小平。新華網在文章中稱，「周小平花千芳確有這樣那樣的不足，但以此苛求他們，既不公平，也不客觀。」\n袁騰飛\n48歲的袁騰飛是北京的一名高中歷史教師，他曾受邀前往中央電視台的《百家講壇》節目，擔任《兩宋風雲》等系列節目的主講，向大眾科普宋代歷史而廣為人知。\n在這個節目錄製前，袁騰飛在中國互聯網上就已小有名氣。他曾經在一家輔導機構講歷史課的片段被人上傳到視頻網站。他幽默風趣的講課方式讓他吸引了相當多的粉絲，視頻片段在一個月內的點擊量突破了100萬次，被網友稱為「史上最牛歷史老師」。\n然而，隨著他的走紅，他的一些言論也引發了網友的質疑，一些網友認為他課程的部分細節內容存在史實錯誤，他還被發現有批評中共領導人毛澤東的言論，從而受到很多左派支持者的圍攻和舉報。\n2017年9月，他的微博和微信公眾號等多個社交平台都突然被關閉。在中國多家視頻網站上，他的講課視頻也遭到大規模刪除。\n崔永元\n在中國社交平台上，很少有人能像崔永元一樣經歷數次起伏，多次深陷輿論漩渦。今年57歲的崔永元此前是中國央視最知名的節目主持人之一，在中國家喻戶曉。\n他曾主持坦誠對話的電視節目《實話實說》，並在很多社會議題上仗義執言，這在社交媒體上為他贏得了近2000萬粉絲。但他旗幟鮮明地反對轉基因食品，讓他捲入了不少的口角和糾紛中。\n他在2013年宣佈離開央視，前往大學任教，同時在上海東方衛視擔任一檔新聞評論節目的主持人，但該節目3個月不到便突然停播。\n2018年，崔永元爆料多個娛樂圈明星通過「陰陽合同」進行避稅的醜聞，其中包括中國最著名的影星范冰冰，這在娛樂圈掀起軒然大波。范冰冰最終被處繳納近8.84億元人民幣（1.25億美元）的天價罰款。\n崔永元在中國互聯網世界的最後一次爭議是2018年12月，他連續發帖指一樁延宕十餘年的訴訟案件的部分卷宗在中國最高法院審理期間「被盜走」。他的爆料引發廣泛關注，但中國當局發佈了與之相反的調查結。他隨後發微博致歉，表示自己「輕信未經仔細證實的資料」。\n事發後，他的微博賬戶儘管沒有被移除，但已停止更新，有關他的新聞頁面不斷遭到刪除。今年5月，他在推特上稱自己的微信賬號也遭到封禁。有報道指，他還被限制出境。"

  chinese_body: "因香港《逃犯條例》修訂案引發的示威活動已滿一週年，幾百名示威者為了逃避香港的牢獄之災，選擇離鄉背井流亡海外，其中幾十人選擇流亡到加拿大，申請政治庇護。\n他們如何適應新生活？如何回首過去一年的香港？對自己和香港的未來有什麼期許？\nBBC中文訪問了兩位流亡到加拿大的香港示威者，了解其想法。\n「除了自由，我什麼都失去了」\n「從香港流亡到加拿大後，可以說是除了自由，我什麼都失去了。你問我值不值得，是有點不值得，這是不太理性。我很想留在香港繼續抗爭，但始終身在海外，我什麼都做不到。」20來歲的阿東是一名香港示威者，自去年參與「反送中」示威被捕後，他開始了超過半年的海外流亡生活，目前與其他約幾十名香港抗爭者，在加拿大南部尋求政治庇護。\n阿東學歷不算高，從事建築工作，好的時候月入有幾萬港元，與擁有私樓的家人同住。他形容自己在去年香港示威運動爆發前，是一個對政治冷感的人，「覺得賺錢最重要」。\n一年前的6月，他身在中國大陸，計劃拿著積蓄去當地投資和工作。後來香港爆發史上最大規模的遊行示威，反對《逃犯條例》修訂，香港政府一度毫不讓步，他趕緊從大陸趕回香港，加入示威行列，當天完全沒有想過，一年後的今天，他會變成身在加拿大。\n香港連場大規模抗議，示威者訴求從反修例，延伸至調查警察暴力以及普選等民主訴求。\n阿東以「勇武派」示威者的身份多次出現在示威現場，其最重要的原因，是不滿運動期間警方的強硬執法。身穿黑衣的「勇武派」示威者是採取武力及激進手段抗爭的示威者。\n「為什麼示威者要用武力？因為初期抗議時，我們沒有做很大衝擊行為，警察便驅散，之後還衝過來不斷追打示威者，用棍打到多個人倒地也繼續打，當時示威者的裝備仍然只有盾，可能有些人有零星磚頭，但汽油彈也沒有，那一下我整個心態就變了，我們不會舉起雙手任由讓你打，我也要還擊。」\n持續多個月的警民衝突，累積了彼此的仇恨，阿東近乎每周都出去「打一場」，從來不做「裝修」等行為，但一見到警察追打示威者，他會成為嘗試反擊的那一個人，結果他在一次抗議中，被防暴警察當場制服，後以「暴動」等多條罪名被捕。\n在去年的示威浪潮中，「勇武派」所稱的「裝修」行為，指的是針對香港公共設施和親北京的商家採取的「打砸破壞」等暴力活動，他們的「裝修」行動讓許多商店、鐵路和基礎設施面目全非，受損嚴重。\n在中國大陸和香港政府眼中，他們是「暴徒」，行為近乎「恐怖主義」，犧牲香港和平穩定；但示威者認為，當局的不讓步和打壓，造成了衝突無限升級。\n一年過去，全港近9000人被捕，1600多人被起訴，涉及暴動、襲警、非法襲擊、藏有攻擊性武器等罪名，當中暴動罪刑期最高刑罰為監禁十年，比起其他罪名更嚴重。\n為什麼阿東不願意留在香港接受審判？他說，因為不信任香港警察和香港司法制度。他在訪問中指控稱，被捕時有警員把不屬於他的武器放進其袋中（BBC無法獨立驗證這一說法，香港警方多次強調自己公正執法），而他亦被警方指控有份策劃暴動。阿東對此一概否認，認為這是強行安插罪名在他身上。法庭方面，他亦批評香港法官的政治色彩越來越濃厚，有法官曾經稱讚在街頭砍人的親政府人士「情操高尚」，無法相信示威者會得到公平審訊。\n記者問他，連續幾個月武力抗爭的最大效果是什麼，他坦言，自己不太能說清楚，「除了在立法會外阻止了二讀《逃犯條例》修訂案外，沒有什麼算是爭取得到，也可以說是多了人支持香港獨立，現在早已超出五大訴求了。」\n被捕過後，他透過一個不具名組織的幫忙離開香港，「家人當然是很不開心，哭得很慘，但他們都是黃的（親民主派），寧願我離開，也比坐牢好，我知那時候不可以再留在香港，都非常決絶地離開便離開了。離開香港那天，我很害怕，擔心被阻止離境，但沒想到這麼順利就讓我走，也許我算是幸運的一個……」\n他告訴BBC中文，選擇加拿大作為流亡地點，是因為在當地申請政治庇護時，可以工作賺錢，也有足夠的生治補貼，但在其他地方，申請庇護期間工作可能會被視為非法勞工。阿東說，只要願意從事低下階層的工作，即使自己英語程度欠佳，也可以找到工作。\n「我很討厭去旅行，從來沒有走出亞洲，想不到這樣過來，經歷了這邊零下20幾度的冬天，我剛開始都足不出戶，現在天氣好了點，有出門打球，習慣了嗎？其實我沒有很大感覺，在家中大部分時間沒有什麼事情可做。」\n身在異鄉，他最惦掛的不是家人，而是香港示威中認識的伙伴，在遠方看見他們一個個被捕，感到痛心，「我們都是為了香港，而不是為了自身利益，但他們可能要坐5、6年監，一些人就要逃離香港，當然很痛心。而在疫情爆發後，很多香港人連走出來也不太敢，有少少不開心，你們是否放棄了？大家仍然記得當天的訴求嗎？」\n「我很想回香港繼續勇武抗爭，流亡海外的示威者，很多人原本是手足，但漸漸失去了心中那團火，但我還有那團火，我希望可以在未來做點什麼，但這些東西日後再算，始終我人在海外，做不到什麼實際事情。」\n「和你過去的人生道別」\n約30歲的阿信同樣是流亡到加拿大申請政治庇護的香港示威者，他和一般流亡者不同，自稱是一名中產商人，透過投資等不同途徑，有穩定收入，足夠支持他生活所需，無須在加拿大急著找工作。\n他曾在示威中涉「暴動」罪名被捕，但擔心自己身份曝光，拒絶透露被捕細節，或交代流亡加拿大的過程，他只是稱香港理工大學警民衝突一役，是他決心離開的導火線。\n「我家人也是很黃的（親民主派），其實我在去年6、7月已經向他們交代了，會有大問題發生，家人已有心理凖備，但沒想過這麼快就要走。」\n起初，他也是打算留在香港坐監一兩年，但後來越來越多「暴動」案出現，刑期更長，他認為不值得花時間去坐牢，令他失去參與抗爭的機會和時間。\n「現在不是公民抗命的時候，公民抗命是要道德感召更多人，香港已經有二百萬人上街了，不用再犧牲去道德感召其他人，要覺醒的人已經醒了，現在是做其他事情的時候……如果只是留在香港不斷上街抗議，叫喊口號，做少許事或發表了一些言論就坐牢，不值得，但我尊重有一班人堅持這條路，」他說。\n香港一些建制派政客曾經質疑，為什麼一些示威者不留在香港接受法律制裁，認為犯法便應該受罰。\n阿信回應說，「我們只是犯法，而沒有犯罪，我們這批人離開，不是因為害怕審訊，而是希望留著有用之軀去做更多的事情。離開香港不是躲起來，過自己的新生活，我從頭到尾也不是這樣想，沒有打算去別國過另一個國家的人的生活，我是熱愛自由的香港人，現在在加拿大只是短暫停留，難民的身分不會阻止我繼續抗爭。」\n阿信多年前已經參與社運，大學畢業後，認為金錢在抗爭中最重要，所以一直埋首工作，想辦法賺錢，讓自己財政獨立，家人也不用擔心金錢的問題。\n他很早便認定，「一國兩制」沒有用，中共不會容許香港有民主，而在沒有民主的情況下，香港市民任何的訴求，也不會得到當局的回應，「有理性的人都知道，經歷了近十年的抗爭， 『五大訴求、缺一不可』等等，都是單純口號，香港沒有自主性時，這些訴求都是難以達成的目標，你沒可能依靠極權政府回應訴求，這是幻想、毫無可能，現在要讓香港有自主性，首要思考如何令香港獨立。」\n過去一年，他認為「勇武示威者」最大的作用，是在這場運動中，告訴中港政府有人願意以更激烈的方式反抗，向世界展示了「中共政權的邪惡」，感召更多人投入運動，支持「港獨」，及刺激同路人思考不同的抗爭手法。\n在「反送中」示威之前，香港反對派擔心「港獨」觸碰中共的紅線，「港獨」只是一少撮人的口號，但經過過去一年，示威現場頻頻出現的口號，不再單純是「光復香港，時代革命」，而是「香港獨立，唯一出路」。中港政府嚴厲譴責「港獨」，認為這牽涉海外反華勢力，危害中國國家安全，不符合香港的長遠利益。\n這種「港獨」思潮在中共推出香港版《國安法》下，燃燒得更旺盛，目前在香港叫喊「港獨」口號或高舉「港獨」旗幟也不會被抓，不過港府多次譴責有關思想和倡議，提倡「港獨」的「香港民族黨」前年被當局以國家安全為由被取締。《國安法》立法後，外界認為會進一步打擊「港獨」組織及個人，有建制聲音認為，在集會高叫「港獨」口號也應被視為違法。\n阿信坦言，要爭取「港獨」等同是要「打倒中共」，香港需要不同的「國際盟友」，自己離開香港就是希望「勾結外國勢力」，連結海外反共組織和勢力，在海外繼續發聲，為「港獨」鋪路，甚至支持香港流亡者籌組海外流亡政府。\n這種說法肯定會違法之後正式實行的香港版《國安法》。「港獨」是否真的可行？他能否爭取香港大多數人或國際盟友的支持？他坦言，「很多人覺得我癡人說夢，很虛無，沒有什麼意義，我都承認是很長遠和充滿困難，很多人也不理會我，一些流亡到海外的人，也沒有這種決心和覺悟，但夢想要遠大才有意義。」\n具體短期內他想要做什麼呢？他說，希望把勇武抗爭的模式帶到海外，例如在海外港人集會上保護參與人士免受親北京的「小粉紅」騷擾，又或是聯繫外國組織和勢力，到使領館抗議，透過不斷表態去讓海外的人和政府，了解對抗中共的必要性。\n他接受記者訪問時，不願多談加拿大的生活，只多次重申自己只是短暫停留，不排除疫情過後轉到其他地方，對香港也沒有特別不捨的地方。\n「我現在做的事，不再只是香港民主運動，而是世界自由民主的運動，有人需要負責先走一步，時代選中了我們這群香港人，」他說，「我們沒有了一個典型的人生，不會結婚生小孩，我們現在是談革命，雖然不是流血那種革命，但革命也是你生命的變革，需要犧牲和覺悟，和你過去的人生道別。」\n流亡各地的香港示威者\n香港數以百計的示威者擔心在香港得不到公平審訊而選擇流亡海外，一些人以讀書或工作簽證逗留境外，一些人則申請政治庇護。\n除了加拿大以外，台灣、英國、德國、荷蘭、澳洲等地也是香港示威者選擇流亡的地點。台灣是最多示威者率先考慮的熱門地點，官方沒有透露有多少人前往台灣，據香港和台灣媒體估計，人數數以百計，部分年輕人選擇入學改為學生簽證，亦有少數人獲批政治庇護，台灣蔡英文政府曾表明，會成立「香港人道援助行動專案」，但至今未披露細節。\n根據英國政府數據，在2019年第四季和2020年第一季，收到共13名來自香港的人提出庇護的申請。而澳洲政府的數據就顯示在去年11月至今年4月，收到至少62名香港人申請庇護。這些庇護申請不一定跟香港示威有關，但可能性很大。\n加拿大媒體早前披露，有幾十名香港人在當地申請政治庇護。加拿大副總理克里斯蒂婭•弗裏蘭（Chrystia Freeland）被問到有關問題時稱，不能夠評論個別庇護申請，稱當局就每個個案都會「非常小心仔細」去作出決定，她同時指出，加拿大從香港移民中獲益巨大，這些來自香港的移民對社會有很大貢獻。\n加拿大移民律師李克倫（Richard Kurland）對BBC中文表示，單純的香港示威者這一身份不足以申請庇護，要視乎他們能否證明到自己有可能遭受嚴重檢控，會否在國際標凖下受到虐待，以及他們有沒有其他選擇。\nBBC中文了解到，部分流亡海外的示威者未有被捕。李克倫說，如果一些示威者未有被捕，只是認為自己可能被起訴，就很可能申請不到難民保護。\n根據加拿大移民部門的資料，要完成難民保護申請整個程序需時約22個月，等候的過程亦可以申請工作准許證，完成後再需時約22個月才能成為當地永久居民。\n加拿大華人及東南亞法律援助中心總監吳瑤瑤對BBC中文表示，就算申請被拒，也會再次進行風險評估，去決定是否把他們遞解出境，這個程序又會花幾年時間。\n吳瑤瑤強調，審批難民申請的部門是獨立機關，加拿大政府不能夠施加政治壓力。\n中加關係因為華為高管孟晚舟等事件轉冷，一些加拿大媒體和觀察人士分析認為，加拿大如果公開接納香港流亡示威者，會影響中加關係，但政界目前對這批香港示威者抱同情，多名加拿大政客表態認為人道立場上需要接納香港移民，未見強烈反對聲音。\n應受訪者要求，阿東、阿信為化名。\nBBC中文記者雷展程對此文亦有貢獻。"

  chinese_body: " 在連續56天沒有出現本地新冠肺炎病例後，中國的首都北京突然在兩天內新增7宗本土病例，另有46人為陽性無症狀感染者，引發人們對疫情捲土重來的擔憂。\n新增病例沒有前往其他疫區的歷史，但他們都曾到訪過北京南郊的一家大型食材批發市場。中國媒體報道稱，檢疫人員在切割進口三文魚的案板上發現了病毒。\n在武漢疫情蔓延初期，同樣是從事食材批發為主的華南海鮮市場成為疫情快速擴散的溫牀。\n面對新疫情，北京如臨大敵。當局連夜下架所有三文魚產品，並宣佈取消各類體育賽事活動、推遲部分學生復課、禁止群體性聚餐。\n突現新增病例\n北京市疾控中心通報，周五（6月12日）新增6例新冠病例，突如其來的爆發讓這座本已接近恢復正常的城市再度陷入緊張。\n根據官方通報，這些病例都有北京市豐台區新發地批發市場的暴露史。他們中有在該市場工作的銷售員和司機，也有前往該市場採購肉製品的顧客，以及兩名執行食品抽檢工作的研究機構員工。\n前一天（6月11日），北京報告了該城市近兩個月來的首個本地病例。 北京市疾控中心介紹這位西城區的患者近兩周無出京史、無外來人員密切接觸史，但曾經去過餐廳，到過菜市場和便民菜店購物。\n官方通報還顯示，被確診7人中的4人都在周二（6月9日）出現症狀。\n北京市疾病預防控制中心副主任龐星火在周六的新聞發佈會上說，當局對近2000名市場從業人員進行了咽拭子樣本採集，以進行核酸檢測。其中，新發地市場採集的517件樣品中，有45人呈陽性，還有1人是在另一家市場工作的密切接觸者也呈陽性。\n此外，市場中採集的40件環境樣本也呈現陽性。批發市場董事長對中國媒體《新京報》表示，檢測到新冠病毒的地方包括一個切割進口三文魚的案板。\n儘管流行病學調查仍在繼續，但種種跡象顯示疫情已再度在中國的生鮮市場爆發。\n「防止疫情反彈和蔓延的形勢十分嚴峻……必須做好和病毒做長期鬥爭的凖備，」北京市政府新聞發言人徐和建說。\n此外，位於中國東北部的遼寧省也在周六通報了2例新增無症狀感染者病例。當局表示，他們均為北京確診病例的密切接觸者。\n重啟「戰時」管控\n在新的疫情爆發後，北京迅速收緊了剛放鬆不久的疫情應對措施，市場所在地豐台區宣佈啟動「戰時機制\"，成立現場指揮部來處理此輪疫情。\n當局連夜對全市的生鮮、畜禽肉類和水產品進行食品安全檢查，很多餐館超市也宣佈下架三文魚產品。\n北京市還宣佈，從即日起暫停舉辦各類體育賽事活動、推遲部分學生復課、停止群體性聚餐，多處旅遊景點也暫停開放。\n剛剛開業的豐台體育中心游泳館也在周六發佈公告說，游泳館被要求緊急閉館; 而昨天，該游泳館剛剛發佈了「終於開業啦！滿血復工，為你全程護航」的公告。\n此外，新發地市場被完全關閉，周邊的11個小區進行封閉式管理，大量附近居民被要求進行核酸檢測。\n住在新發地市場約6公里外的一名居民對BBC說，周六一早便有檢查人員挨家挨戶敲門，訊問其是否有前往該市場或從外地回來。\n「小區門口也馬上搞了鐵皮柵欄，進出都要進行測溫，一切都像回到了二月份，」他說道。\n新發地市場位於北京南郊，曾被當地人稱為北京居民的「菜籃子」和「果盤子」，因為這裏承擔著北京80%以上的蔬菜和水果供應。這裏同時也提供生肉和海鮮的銷售，其中，豬肉佔北京供應總量約10%。\n不過，上海市新冠肺炎醫療救治專家組組長張文宏認為，儘管疫情再次出現，但無需「採取過度防疫，終止經濟和民生的復蘇」。\n「中國會持續處於『接近零（本土）病例』的狀態，而並非『無病例』，」他說道。\n病毒怎麼來的？\n此次在北京市場中爆發的疫情，讓人們回想起武漢疫情爆發初期，同樣是從事食材批發的華南海鮮市場成為了疫情快速擴散的溫牀。\n儘管科學界至今對華南海鮮市場是否是武漢疫情的源頭持懷疑態度，但環境髒亂、人員混雜的市場無疑加快了病毒的傳播，以至於武漢的早期病例中近一半都有該市場的暴露史。\n與華南海鮮市場略有不同的是，新發地市場主要銷售蔬菜和水果，肉類和海鮮只佔一小部分。熟悉該市場的人士表示，該市場雖有肉類銷售，但主要是生肉，而非動物活體，這意味著病毒不太可能是在市場的牲畜間進行傳播。\n中國媒體此前報道稱，檢疫人員在切割進口三文魚的案板上發現了新冠病毒，這讓一些人感到疑惑，因為此前報告的新冠病毒的宿主都是哺乳動物，而非魚類。\nBBC中文發現，目前科學界對於魚類是否能感染新冠病毒的研究較少，但有一些研究結果認為，魚類感染新冠病毒的概率相對較低。\n有來自馬來西亞國立大學（Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia）和倫敦大學學院（University College London）的團隊今年5月在預印本平台發佈研究，認為新冠病毒可以感染範圍廣泛的哺乳動物，但不包括魚、鳥類或爬行動物。\n一些專家更傾向於認為病毒可能是後期沾染到魚類產品上的。\n位於上海的華科同濟醫院感染科的一名要求匿名的醫生則對官方媒體《健康時報》說，海鮮市場的潮濕環境利於病毒存活，加上海鮮大都要求低溫儲存，低溫也適於新冠病毒的生存，使得海鮮市場環境內病毒存活時間比其他地方時間長。"

  chinese_body: "中國與印度最近在有爭議的邊界附近發生了較大規模的暴力衝突，印方消息稱至少20名印度士兵死亡。如果證實，這是數十年來兩國之間最血腥的一次邊界衝突。\n印度總理莫迪高調表示，印度士兵「不能白死」，而中國外長王毅則要求嚴懲肇事責任人。\n印度國內對中國的敵對情緒迅速高漲，反中示威和要求地址中國貨的運動此起彼伏，令很多人回想起半個多世紀前的那場中印戰爭之後那些幾乎被人遺忘的印度華人的遭遇。\n1962年10月，中印邊境戰爭爆發。對當年生活在印度的許多華人而言，那場持續了一個月的戰爭改變了他們的一生。\n印度排華潮\n生活在倫敦東南肯特郡80多歲的翠娟，就是那場戰爭的受害者之一。\n1962年中印爆發戰爭後，印度對華人的政策大變，她的父親不得不放棄在印度經營的船塢和航運生意，帶著全家離開加爾各答到英國定居。他們從此再也沒有回過印度。\n翠娟說，她和家人雖然被迫拋下了在印度的家產到英國謀生，但比起很多當年的同胞，自己仍算幸運。\n1962年中印邊境戰爭爆發後，印度迅速出台《國防法》（Defence of India Act and Defence of India rules 1962），授權政府可以不經法律程序「逮捕和拘留任何（懷疑）有敵對出身的人」。在這一法令下，任何有華人姓名、華人血統、甚至長相近似華人的都可能被逮捕。他們中的許多人雖然祖籍中國，卻已經幾代人在印度生活。\n當時，印度各地數以千計的華人華裔被抓。據估計，受影響的華人華裔約為2萬至4萬人。\n其中大約7500人獲准離開印度，前往澳大利亞、英國、加拿大、香港、日本和美國等地。而那些不願離開或者沒有足夠財力離開的人，不少被送往印度西北部拉賈斯坦邦的代奧利拘留營（Deoli）。\n代奧利拘留營\n代奧利拘留營位於拉賈斯坦邦首府齊浦爾（Jaipur）西南約165公里，曾經是英軍在二戰時期設立的戰俘營。1984年這座戰俘營被改建為訓練中心，在它的牌匾上寫著這裏曾經關押過德國、日本和中國犯人，儘管這些華人從來沒有參加過與印度的任何戰爭。\n大約3000名華人被關押在這個拘留營，其中六成是老人和兒童。最後一批被關押的印度華人到1967年才獲釋。如今被保存在互聯網上的《代奧利日記》（The Deoli Diaries） 記載了很多人當年在這個拘留營中的記憶。\n中國印度邊境日前發生暴力衝突後，《印度時報》網站報道代奧利拘留營的歷史時引述印度歷史學者麗瑪·胡賈（Rima Hooja） 的話說：這些華人少數民族因為戰爭局勢被政府關押在代奧利拘留營。在這樣的局勢中，少數民族(華人)與（中國）公民本應該有非常明確的界限，但是在危機時期這樣的界限卻被模糊了。\n2020年2月， 出生在代奧利拘留營的馬愛芳（Joy Ma）和記者迪利普·德叟扎（Dilip D\'Souza）合著的《代奧利：1962年印度華人被拘押的真實故事》（The Deoliwallahs: The True Story of the 1962 Chinese-Indian Internment）出版。\n此書記錄了仍然生活在印度和移民到海外的印度華人對拘留營的回憶。\n作者之一的德叟扎曾向媒體表示，被關押在代奧利拘留營的很多印度華人最終獲得釋放返回原住地時發現，他們的家、他們的生計都已經被毀或被充公，有的甚至不准返回住處。\n「他們就這樣失去了一切，遭遇滅頂打擊，想不明白為什麼會遭遇國家如此的對待。很多人嘗試重新生活，但很少成功。被囚禁多年，加上街坊鄰里的仇視都是他們過不去的坎。」"

  chinese_body: "在英國，黑人雖然佔英國總人口比例不高，但很早就參與了英國歷史的塑造。\n美國黑人佛洛伊德之死引發包括英國在內的全球聲援黑人維權的抗議活動之際，英國黑人團體呼籲英國政府應該加強中小學裏對英國黑人歷史貢獻的教育。\n根據英國2011年人口調查資料，來自非洲和加勒比海地區的黑人佔英格蘭與威爾士人口（這兩個地區人口約佔全英國總人口的89%）的3.3%，是英格蘭與威爾士僅次南亞裔的第2大少數民族。\n在很大程度上，跨大西洋販賣奴隸和美國民權運動是英國中小學校教授的唯一黑人歷史。英國通常還在10月份慶祝黑人歷史月。\n這篇文章列出英國中小學校沒有教過的一些重要的英國黑人歷史。\n一、戴象牙鐲子的女人\n黑人在英國的歷史最早可追溯到古羅馬時期。在當時羅馬帝國治下的不列顛，有來自帝國其他地區的人，包括黑人。\n戴象牙鐲子的女人是1901年在英國約克考古中發現的一具混血女子遺骸的名字。她現在呈列在約克博物館。\n考古分析顯示，雖然她出生在羅馬時期的英國，她很可能是北非人的後裔。遺骸的年代可追溯到公元3-4世紀下半葉。\n她的遺骸躺在一具石棺中，裏面還發現陪葬的煤精玉，象牙手鐲，耳環，吊墜，珠子，一個藍色玻璃壺和一面玻璃鏡子。\n這些珍寶陪葬，暗示了她當時顯赫的身世。它也說明，黑人並非就一定是窮人。\n二、亨利八世的黑人號兵\n在英格蘭都鐸王朝時期，已經有數百名黑人生活在英國。\n都鐸王朝時期是1485到1603年之間的事情。那大約是中國明朝時代。\n約翰·布蘭克，是一個非洲號兵，歷史學家認為他的名字就與他的黑人背景有關。\n他就是都鐸王朝時期在英國的一位黑人。他的形象被畫在一幅60英尺長的羊皮畫卷上，並且出現了兩次。\n這幅著名的畫卷是英國都鐸王朝時期留下的珍貴歷史文物，名為1511年威斯敏斯特騎士馬上槍術比武賽，這是英格蘭國王亨利八世為慶祝一個兒子的誕生而精心策劃舉辦的大型派對。\n在英國的博物館文物中，可以發現布蘭克作為亨利八世的一名號兵從宮廷每個月得到固定工資的記錄，甚至還有一封布蘭克寫給亨利八世的信，要求加薪。\n三、英國的第一位黑人王后\n她是一位來自德國的公主，在嫁給國王喬治三世後成為英國王后。許多歷史學家認為夏洛特王后有非洲血統。\n他們於1761年結婚，夏洛特是兩位英國君主喬治四世和威廉四世的母親。有些人認為，儘管夏洛特王后來自德國，但卻是葡萄牙王室黑人分支的後裔。\n葡萄牙國王阿方索三世在13世紀從摩爾人那裏征服了法魯城。摩爾人是來自北非的穆斯林，中世紀大約13世紀的時候他們統治並生活在現代的西班牙和葡萄牙。阿方索被認為和法魯城總督的女兒生了3個孩子。\n據說，他們的一個兒子馬蒂姆·阿方索·奇喬羅也娶了一個有黑人血緣的家庭的女子。他和他的妻子伊內斯·盧倫科·德·索薩·德瓦拉德雷斯創立了葡萄牙的蘇薩-奇喬羅家族，這個家族有許多著名後裔，包括夏洛特王后在內。\n夏洛特王后的一個孫女則成為了英國的維多利亞女王。\n四、販奴貿易和廢奴運動時期\n不論夏洛特王后是否有非洲血統，她進入英國王室之時，大約正值17-18世紀跨大西洋奴隸貿易興衰之際。\n當時英國參與了歐洲、非洲和美洲之間的奴隸貿易，和依靠奴隸勞動興起的煙草棉花大種植園貿易，不少英國和美國人通過販賣奴隸積累了巨額財富。\n一些英國城市因為參與有關航運和貿易，港口城市迅速繁榮崛起。除了倫敦以外，布里斯托爾，利物浦，卡迪夫和格拉斯哥等城市迅速擴大。\n在這些城市，少數黑人成為自由人，黑人定居點有所增加，這是英國黑人社區發展的最重要因素。\n英國人既是奴隸貿易的參與者，也是廢奴運動的倡導者。\n經過英國廢奴運動倡導者的不懈努力，1807年，英國通過了廢除奴隸販賣法案（Slave Trade Act），規定在大英帝國境內販奴為非法。1833年英國通過了廢奴法案（Slavery Abolition Act），宣佈大英帝國全境廢除奴隸制，比美國1865年廢除奴隸制早了30多年。\n五、一次大戰及英美種族騷亂\n在第一次世界大戰期間，英國缺乏兵源，很多大英帝國殖民地的黑人參軍路經英國前往歐洲前線。\n隨著商船海員和士兵的到來，黑人社區的規模進一步增長。當時，還有一小批來自非洲和加勒比地區的學生移居倫敦。\n戰後，他們大多被遣返回自己的家鄉。但也有一些居留下來。\n戰後隨著大批英軍士兵復員返鄉，失業問題嚴重。英國和美國的種族主義者將經濟蕭條導致的失業潮歸咎於黑人和其他英國少數族裔，對他們進行了暴力攻擊。\n被稱為1919年種族騷亂的事件在格拉斯哥，利物浦，卡迪夫和英國其他海港城市爆發，在此期間，3人死亡，數百人受傷。\n衝突也產生了經濟後果。英國許多黑人退伍軍人和工人髮現，在很多行業工作申請實行填寫種族一欄後，他們找不到工作。白人工人往往能得到工會的支持，白人工會也拒絶團結吸收黑人。\n許多黑人被送回戰前居住的國家。貧窮和缺乏工作是騷亂的一個重要因素，但據歷史研究人員傑米·貝克（Jamie Baker）說，當時人們還擔心黑人男子可能和白人婦女組建家庭。\n二戰及戰後的「疾風時代」\n如同第一次世界大戰期間一樣，在第二次世界大戰期間，英軍同樣有很多大英帝國殖民地的黑人參軍參戰。\n而二戰結束後，英國本土戰後重建奇缺勞動人口，大批來自加勒比和非洲的黑人以及南亞的印度人被招募到英國參與重建，英國開啟了大規模引入移民的「疾風時代」。\n他們中很多人被分配到英國公立全民醫療系統（NHS）和其他公共部門工作，比如駕駛公共汽車。\n但當時社會上種族歧視還不被認為是非法行為，種族歧視問題仍然嚴重。在布里斯托爾，由市議會負責管理運營的綜合公交公司拒絶僱用黑人和亞裔司機，最終導致整個城市的公共汽車遭到抵制。\n當時在美國的黑人民權運動正風起雲湧。後來成為美國黑人民權運動標誌性人物之一的羅莎·帕克斯（Rosa Parks）女士拒絶在公交車上給白人讓座被警察逮捕，激起美國各地抵制公交車抗議。這給啟發了英國來自西印度群島的4名年青黑人。\n1963年，他們發動了用靜坐、堵塞道路等行動抗議布里斯托爾公交公司種族歧視政策，不僅受到黑人團體的支持，並很快得到了反對種族歧視政策的白人民眾支持，其中很多是布里斯托爾大學生，媒體記者和一些年輕的政治領袖，包括當地選區的英國下議員議員托尼·本，以及一年後成為工黨領袖（並之後在大選中獲勝上台出任英國首相）的哈羅德·威爾遜。\n布里斯托爾公交公司被迫放棄種族主義政策，開始僱傭有色族裔人士。\n這一事件推動了英國議會於1965年正式通過《種族關係法》，規定在公共場合的種族歧視屬於非法。這一法律1968年擴展到政府廉租房分配和僱傭政策等領域。\n當時發起抗議的4名黑人年輕人中的三人：保羅·史蒂芬森，羅伊·哈克特和蓋伊·貝利後來被英國女王授予大英帝國官佐勳章。"

  chinese_body: "肺炎疫情影響全世界，在封城隔離措施下，科技網絡公司成為信息流動人際溝通更加重要的平台。 \n如何讓自身開放的商業平台不涉政治爭議成為很多公司的難題。\n來看看最近成為熱點新聞的4家中美網絡大公司。\n推特Twitter\n推特公司周四（6月11日）宣佈，刪除了17萬多個賬戶，稱這些賬戶都與傳播支持中國的信息有關聯，大多專門用於發佈與香港示威、新冠疫情、台灣等相關的宣傳內容。\n推特公司表示，其中23750個賬戶極為活躍，為宣傳中國的主力，另外約15萬個賬戶被用來點讚和轉發讚揚中國的推文，協助推送中國的宣傳內容。\n推特說，這個宣傳中國的網絡位於中國境內，與去年推特、臉書封鎖的中國官方主導的宣傳網絡有關聯。\n推特在官方博客中表示：整個網絡參與了一系列的有操縱性質並且相互協調的活動。「它們絶大部分用中文推送，傳播對中國共產黨有利的地緣政治言論，而且繼續推送有關香港政治的有欺騙性質的內容。」\n對推特的這一舉動，中國媒體表示：誇中國抗疫表現都不行？批評推特「看不慣用戶誇中國抗疫表現、客觀討論香港事務」，是又一次「下黑手」。\n不過，推特公司除了刪除中國宣傳賬戶, 也「審查」美國總統特朗普的推文。\n5月下旬，推特給特朗普的推文貼上了「事實核查」標籤，提醒受眾注意：此貼可能有誤導性。此舉讓特朗普總統極為憤怒。\n他連續發帖反擊，指責推特「干涉大選、扼殺言論自由，我，作為美國總統，絶對不准這種事發生。」\n推特是美國風靡世界的一家社交媒體公司，提供多種語言服務。成立於2006年的這家公司，據統計2019年共有約3.3億用戶，其中1.45億用戶幾乎每天發推文。\n美國總統特朗普一直被稱為「推特治國」，常常通過推特宣佈重要決定。上周五（6月5日），特朗普在24小時內發推文200條，再次打破他的個人紀錄。\n臉書Facebook\n推特與美國總統特朗普之間的針鋒相對，與美國社交媒體巨頭臉書形成鮮明對比。\n周四（6月11日）有望成為美國民主黨總統候選人的前副總統拜登呼籲支持者簽署公開信，要求臉書創始人扎克伯格和臉書公司「修正臉書平台上對自由公平選舉構成的威脅」，監管虛假信息和錯誤信息，對政治人物的廣告進行事實查核。\n在臉書公司內部，員工對扎克伯格決定對總統特朗普有關美國抗議行動的推文不採取任何行動極為不滿，有的甚至罷工、辭職以示抗議。\n美國非洲裔青年喬治·佛洛伊德因警察粗暴執法去世後，全國各地爆發抗議行動，總統特朗普在推特和臉書上宣佈將派遣國民衛隊，並警告說：「開始搶劫就開始槍擊」。\n推特立即對特朗普的推文貼出了警告，稱推文「美化暴力」違規，而臉書總裁扎克伯格卻並不認為此帖違反了臉書禁止煽動暴力的規定，沒有刪除總統特朗普在臉書上的貼文。\n包括公民權益組織在內的社會輿論批評扎克伯格，「創下了一個非常危險的先例」，放任「煽動暴力、種族歧視和謊言」。\n扎克伯格5月下旬在接受媒體採訪時曾經表示，臉書甚至其它互聯網平台總的來說不應該成為核查真相的仲裁者。他說： 「政治講話是民主社會中最為敏感的部分，人們應該看到政界人士所講的話。」\n據統計，臉書是世界上最大的社交媒體平台，在2020年第一季度，臉書經常使用者的人數高達26億。\nZoom\n隔離期間遠程會議通訊軟件Zoom突然大受歡迎，許多人用它來開會或與家人朋友視頻對話。\nZoom的全球使用量猛增20倍，疫情期間單日使用人數有突破兩億的紀錄。\n本周，在海外的中國異見人士指責Zoom干擾甚至關閉了他們的帳戶，因為他們用Zoom帳戶舉辦六四紀念活動，討論香港實行國安法等敏感話題。\nZoom在其博客上承認：「在5月和6月初，我們收到中國政府的通知說在社交媒體上公布了四個大型公眾六四紀念集會。中國政府通知我們這類活動在中國是非法的，要求Zoom 終止會議和主辦人的帳戶。」\n該公司還表示，以往沒有向中國政府提供過任何使用者的信息或者會議內容，而且強調媒體上報道的六四異議人士王丹、周鋒鎖和香港民主派人士李卓人的帳戶都已經恢復。\nZoom聲明說：「我們希望有一天那些設立障礙阻斷人民與世界聯繫、阻斷人民彼此聯繫的政府認識到，他們這麼做損害自己的利益，也有違公民的權利和所有人類的權利。」\n「現實是，Zoom 在全世界80多個國家運營，使用國家還在增加，這要求我們必須遵守當地的法規。」\n6月11日，中國外交部發言人華春瑩被法新社記者問及是否要求Zoom暫時關閉一些活動分子的帳戶，華春瑩回答說：「這不是外交問題，你問得太具體了。我沒有聽說，也不了解情況。」\n百度\n不過，對涉及中國疫情的一篇美國哈佛大學研究論文，中國外交部發言人華春瑩提供了非常詳細的回答。\n哈佛大學醫學院的一個研究團隊日前發表論文，透過對武漢醫院附近的交通流量和百度相關搜索關鍵詞，如「咳嗽」、「腹瀉」的檢索量分析認為，新冠病毒可能在去年8月底就開始在武漢傳播。\n華春瑩說，這篇論文「漏洞百出、粗製濫造」，讓美國的政客、媒體如獲至寶，大肆傳播，把它當成中國隱瞞疫情的新證據，是蓄意製造和散播針對中國的虛假信息。\n被牽涉到這起中美疫情政治中的中國搜索引擎公司百度，6月10日公開表態，指論文的結論「非常牽強，不嚴謹」。\n百度是全球最大的中文搜索引擎。 2010年，谷歌（Google）因不滿中國政府的網絡審查制度，以及在中國受到黑客攻擊等原因宣佈退出中國，使百度在中文搜索領域失去一個強有力的競爭對手。"

  chinese_body: "曾兩次擔任教育國務大臣的英國首相胞弟喬·約翰遜（Jo Johnson)日前發表文章，呼籲改革留學生制度，允許國際留學生畢業後在英國工作4年。他指出，應該更好地吸引英聯邦國家留學生，減少對中國留學生的依賴。\n喬·約翰遜的提議旨在振興英國高校，特別是在新冠疫情之後，重新給英國大學注入活力。\n留學改革要點\n根據喬·約翰遜的改革藍圖，英國應該擴招海外留學人才，並在2024年爭取將來自印度留學生的人數翻一番；同時增加對尼日利亞和馬來西亞留學生的招募工作。\n與此同時，喬·約翰遜還表示，負責對外文化和教育交流的英國文化協會（British Council）應進行全面改革，並負責留學生招募工作 。\n受新冠病毒疫情影響，今年會有許多海外留學生推遲來英國留學的時間。\n他還說，為海外留英研究生畢業後提供4年工作簽證有助於提升英國的競爭力，特別是在與美國、加拿大和澳大利亞這些國家爭奪留學生資源和人才時不至於處於劣勢。\n喬·約翰遜是英國首相鮑里斯·約翰遜的弟弟。\n他曾在鮑里斯手下擔任大學與科學國務大臣，但於去年9月辭職。目前在倫敦大學國王學院和哈佛大學肯尼迪政府學院擔任高級研究員。\n減少對中國依賴\n此外，喬·約翰遜也希望這一計劃能夠吸引更多來自英聯邦國家的留學生，以便減少英國高校目前依賴中國留學生的狀況。近年來中國留學生數量在英國海外留學生群體中一直穩居第一。\n最近，英國和中國由於香港問題關係緊張，也可能對中國留學生來英留學產生影響。\nPSW工作簽證\n值得注意的是，英國之前被取消的PSW簽證也將於今年恢復。這一簽證將適用於從2020年開始來英國攻讀碩士研究生學位的國際學生 。PSW工簽將允許留學生畢業後在英國工作兩年。\nPSW簽證在前首相特蕾莎·梅（Theresa May）2012年擔任內政大臣時被取消。PSW簽證取消後，海外學生在畢業後4個月內必須離開英國。\n美國和加拿大允許留學生畢業後停留3年找工作，澳大利亞則允許留學生畢業後停留4年。\n多年以來，美國、英國和澳大利亞一直是海外留學生首選的留學目的地，但最近英國的留學市場出現下滑，總體增長持平。\n雖然中國留學生人數有所增加，但在2010-2017年間來自尼日利亞、印度、巴基斯坦和孟加拉的留學生數量都分別大幅下降。英國大學校長們稱，PSW簽證的取消是英國留學生近年來增長緩慢的關鍵因素之一。\n喬·約翰遜在倫敦國王學院和肯尼迪政府學院發表的文章中建議實行4年工簽。他表示，這將有助於恢復英國高校跟美國、加拿大和澳大利亞競爭的機會。\n喬·約翰遜還建議對英國文化協會進行全面改革， 讓它主管英國海外留學生的招生工作。\n喬·約翰遜說，改革後的英國文化協會將致力於把英國打造成一個全球留學的引領者，使英國成為全球留學目的地，並建立和發展起一個全球學生流動網絡。"

  chinese_body: "中國官媒新華社稱，當地時間6月16日至17日，中共中央政治局委員、中央外事工作委員會辦公室主任楊潔篪應約同美國國務卿蓬佩奧在夏威夷舉行對話。\n路透社引用美國國務院消息稱，美國國務卿蓬佩奧和楊潔篪於周三在美國夏威夷會面。美國國務院官員透露，兩人會面從當地時間9點過開始，持續到下午3點50（周三格林威治時間19：00- 周四格林威治時間01：50）。\n蓬佩奧在過去一段時間經常嚴詞批評北京。兩人上次直接接觸是在4月15日通電話。夏威夷會面前兩人今年還沒有面對面會晤。\n這是中美高層在新冠疫情爆發以來的首次面對面接觸。兩國最近一次高層接觸是今年1月中旬中國副總理劉鶴訪美，在白宮和美國總統特朗普一起出席中美第一階段經貿協議簽署儀式。楊潔篪上次訪美是在去年8月出訪紐約並會見蓬佩奧。習近平和特朗普的上一次會面則要追溯到去年6月在大阪舉行的G20峰會。\n今年以來中美在多個領域針鋒相對，包括兩國就新冠疫情相互指責，美國因為國安法一事宣佈制裁香港等。此外兩國經濟都因疫情出現重大衰退，就業形勢嚴峻。\n新華社稱，雙方充分闡明瞭各自的立場，認為這是一次建設性的對話。雙方同意採取行動，認真落實兩國元首達成的共識，同意將繼續保持接觸和溝通。\n美國國務院公告稱，蓬佩奧和楊潔篪在夏威夷檀香山舉行會面，雙方就中美關係交換意見。蓬佩奧強調了重要的美國利益，強調「兩國應在商業、安全以及外交方面達成完全互惠的協議」。蓬佩奧還強調，在防治新冠疫情和應對以後可能的再次爆發時，必須保持透明和信息分享。\n中國外交部在其網站上以答記者問方式稱，楊潔篪在對話中闡明瞭中方對發展中美關係的基本態度以及在台灣、涉港、涉疆等重要敏感問題上的立場，並表示「中方致力於同美方一道努力，發展不衝突不對抗、相互尊重、合作共贏的關係，同時堅定捍衛自身主權安全發展利益。」\n中國外交部透露的會談要點涉及台灣香港新疆\n兩人會面前後還發生了什麼\n蓬佩奧和楊潔篪的會面正在進行的時候，美國總統特朗普於周三簽署了一項法案，要求制裁對鎮壓中國新疆維吾爾族穆斯林負責的官員。這份名單可能包括中共政治局高層官員。美國國會此前幾乎一致通過了這項法案，該法案旨在在人權問題上向中國發出一個強烈信息。\n包括蓬佩奧在內的七國集團外長今天發佈一份聲明，呼籲中國停止推動頗具爭議的香港《國安法》。\n分析認為中美關係目前已處於近年來的低點。\n中美當前局勢\n美國和中國關係近幾個月以來逐漸緊張，美國總統特朗普甚至還威脅要切斷與中國一切關係。\n蓬佩奧曾經多次發言批評中國，包括新冠病毒疫情的全球擴散，香港《國安法》的通過，以及中國少數民族和少數信仰遭受的待遇等一系列議題。\n與此同時，美國有3艘航母同時巡航太平洋海域，這是近年來首次有如此大規模的軍力展示。\n兩人會面的信息正式公布前，有消息指蓬佩奧此次計劃和中國官員會面，主要是試圖緩解美中雙方近來因為各種緣故而持續緊張的雙邊關係。\n上個月蓬佩奧表示，中國原本有機會可以挽救全球數十萬人的性命，只要在新冠病毒疫情爆發之初更加透明化就好了，但中國卻拒絶和世界各國分享信息。\n蓬佩奧曾高調稱，有「大量證據」證明新冠病毒來自武漢的病毒實驗室；另一邊，中國外交部發言人趙立堅多次稱新冠病毒可能源於美國。他3月份在推特上還具體說到，可能是美國軍隊把病毒帶到武漢的。\n不過，蓬佩奧所說的大量證據迄今仍未亮出；趙立堅髮指稱時也沒有提供證據。中方則說，美方指責中國是為了擺脫自己在國內受到的抗疫不力的質疑、批評和追責。\n但有學者認為，中方在病毒溯源方面的強硬態度與美國的策略有異曲同工之處，同樣是醉翁之意不在酒——中美政壇都在利用病毒溯源爭議設置對各自有利的政治議程，以期轉移國內矛盾。\n美中兩國最近因為香港問題也爭吵不休，蓬佩奧說中國計劃在香港實施的《國安法》，是敲響香港自治的\"喪鐘\"。\n他在國會上作證時表示，中國從根本上破壞了香港的自治，他無法支持香港再享有與1997年前同等的特殊貿易地位。\n特朗普也宣佈將下令取消美國對香港的特殊貿易地位，並將對中國、香港官員實施制裁。\n台灣問題仍然是影響美中兩國關係的一個重點。\n本月早些時候，美軍一架C-40A運輸機從日本沖繩起飛，穿越台灣領空飛向台灣海峽，中國國防部言辭批評美國侵犯中國領土，破壞台海和平穩定。\n台灣總統蔡英文上個月就職時，蓬佩奧也發表聲明特別向蔡英文表示祝賀，並以「總統」稱呼蔡英文，引發中國政府強烈反對。\n美國政府最近還通過向台灣出售18枚MK-48重型魚雷，中國政府表示堅決反對美國對台軍售，損害中美關係和台海和平穩定。"

  chinese_body: "一種便宜且存量巨大的藥物被證實能夠幫助降低感染新型冠狀病毒的重症病人死亡率。\n英國專家表示，含有小劑量類固醇的藥物地塞米松（dexamethasone）成為這場抗疫之戰當中的一個重大突破。\n世界多國正在就現有治療方式對新型冠病毒的有效性進行一次大規模試驗，這種藥物即是其中的一部分。\n它能夠將使用呼吸機的病人死亡風險降低三分之一；對於需要氧氣機的病人來說，它能將死亡率降低五分之一。\n研究者稱，假如在疫情全球大流行之初就使用這種藥物治療在英國的病人，可能就會挽救多達5000條生命。\n而且，它對於有大量2019冠狀病毒病人的較貧窮國家來說，可能是一個巨大的利好。\n英國政府有20萬次療程的此種藥物庫存，並且表示國民醫療保健計劃（NHS）將會向病人提供地塞米松。\n英國首相鮑里斯·約翰遜（Boris Johnson）表示，這是一個值得慶祝的事情，「一個傑出的英國科學成就」，並說：「我們已經採取步驟確保我們即使有第二波高峰的情況下仍然有足夠的供應。」\n英格蘭首席醫務官克里斯·惠蒂教授（Prof Chris Whitty）說，這將在全世界範圍內挽救很多生命。\n每20名新型冠狀病毒病人當中有19人可在不入院的情況下康復。\n在入院的病人當中，大部分亦會康復，不過有一部分可能需要氧氣機或者呼吸機。\n而地塞米松能夠挽救的似乎就是這些高危病人。\n這種藥物已經被用於降低一系列其他情況造成的炎症，包括關節炎、哮喘以及一些皮膚病。\n而且，它似乎能幫助阻止當身體免疫系統對抗冠狀病毒時過度反應而可能造成的身體傷害。\n這種過度反應就是「細胞素風暴」（cytokine storm），嚴重可致命。\n在這次由一個牛津大學團隊領導的測試當中，有約2000名住院病人使用了地塞米松，他們被用來與另外4000名沒有使用這種藥物的病人比較。\n對於要使用呼吸機的病人來說，這種藥物將死亡風險從40%降低至28%。\n對於需要吸氧的病人來說，它將死亡風險從25%降至20%。\n調查主管彼得·霍爾比教授（Prof Peter Horby）說：「這是至目前為止唯一顯示出能降低死亡率的藥物——而且是大大地降低。這是一次重大的突破。」\n領頭的研究人員馬丁·蘭德萊教授（Prof Martin Landray）說，相關的發現顯示，每八名使用呼吸機的病人和每20至25名需要吸氧的病人當中分別都有一人可免於死亡。\n「這是清楚明白的一個好處，」他說。\n「這種治療是長達10天地使用地塞米松，大約每個病人5英鎊。」\n「所以實質上，是用35英鎊挽救一條生命。」\n「這是一種全球都能找得到的藥。」\n蘭德萊教授說，在適當的時候，醫院應該從現在開始就給病人提供這種藥，事不宜遲。\n不過，人們不應該自己出去買回家吃。\n地塞米松似乎對於輕微症狀、不需要機械幫助呼吸的新冠感染者沒有幫助。\n自三月起開始運行的「The Recovery Trail」測試還研究了瘧疾藥物羥氯喹（hydroxychloroquine），但它之後被放棄，因為有人擔心它有增加死亡率和心臟問題的風險。\n另一方面，抗病毒藥物瑞德西韋（remdesivir）似乎能縮短新冠病人康復時間，已經由國民保健署批准供應。\n分析\nBBC衛生事務記者弗格斯·沃爾什（Fergus Walsh）\n第一種被證實能降低2019冠狀病毒病（COVID-19）的藥物並非什麼新的貴價藥，而是一種像薯條一樣便宜的舊類固醇。\n這是一件值得慶祝的事，因為這意味著全世界的病人可能會馬上因此受惠。\n也正因為此，這次測試當中的前線研究成果很快被公布出來——因為這當中對於全球來說意義非常重大。\n地塞米松是自1960年代初就開始用於治療一系列疾病，比如類風濕關節炎和哮喘。\n在需要使用呼吸機的新冠病人當中，有半數活不成，所以能將這個風險降低三分之一，有著巨大的作用。\n這種藥物在重症監護當中是通過靜脈注射使用，對於病情稍輕的病人則是吃藥片。\n目前為止，除此之外僅有被證明對新冠病人有好處的藥物是瑞德西韋，它一直是被用於治療埃博拉病毒（Ebola，伊波拉）。\n它已經顯示出能將新冠病毒症狀的時長從15天減少到11天。\n但是，尚沒有足夠有力的證據表明它能降低死亡率。\n與地塞米松不同的是，瑞德西韋是一種新藥，供應量有限，而且具體價格尚未公布。\n新冠病毒更多報道："

  chinese_body: "美國商務部最新宣佈，美國公司將更全面地與中國通訊業巨頭華為合作，共同制定5G等技術標凖。\n這在美國與中國日益加劇的貿易、輿論、科技、新冠疫情等廣泛衝突中，頗為令人意外。\n而尤其重要的是2019年美國商務部將華為列入「實體清單」，以國家安全為理由限制美國公司向華為出售商品和技術，對華為造成巨大衝擊。\n那麼，美國的最新規定是要對華為網開一面嗎？\n新規定目的\n美國商務部部長韋伯·羅斯（Wilbur Ross）宣佈了這一新的規定，稱其目的是為了「確保美國業界更全面參與通訊領域的標凖制定活動」，「美國的參與和領導將影響未來5G、自動駕駛、人工智能和其他領先技術。」\n美國商業部表示，「不會放棄全球創新領導者的地位」， 要通過這一行動「鼓勵美國業者全面採用和提倡美國技術成為國際標凖，來保護美國國家安全和對外政策利益。」\n根據美國商務部的新規定，美國公司可以向華為分享用於制定行業標凖的技術。\n新規定背景\n美國業界和政府官員表示，這項新規則調整不應被視為美國反對華為的決心有所減弱。\n他們稱，把華為列入實體名單使得美國在技術標凖制定方面居於劣勢。而技術標凖是全世界各家企業產品開發規則的依據，只有統一技術標凖才能使不同廠商生產的設備能夠彼此銜接協調運作。 \n此前，由於美國企業不確定哪些技術可以與華為分享，所以減少了參與標凖制定，使華為在標凖制定上有了更大的話語權。\n不過，美國商務部的規定仍然強調，美國公司與華為分享技術，只是為了制定標凖，「不是商業目的」。出於商業用途向華為出售技術仍然需要報備，符合美國的要求。\n各方反應\n總部設在美國首都華盛頓的信息技術產業協會（Information Technology Industry Council）對美國商務部的決定表示歡迎。\n該協會亞洲政策高級總監瑙米·威爾遜（Naomi Wilson）向美國媒體表示，美國公司參與制定標凖極為重要。美國公司因為政府規定而被迫退出標凖制定，任何人都沒有好處，只符合中國方面的利益。\n華為公司還沒有就美國政府的這一新規定發表評論。不過華為此前一直強調，在連接領域曾經有過歷史教訓，追求統一的標凖是通訊業的共識。\n5月，華為輪值董事長郭平曾經表示，過去的經驗表明，製造商、運營商、消費者，都能在統一標凖的世界獲得利益。「華為將積極參與支持和持續合作的方式，推動全球統一標凖的實現。」\n華為5G\n中國在2019年11月正式進入5G商用時代，推出了世界上最大的5G網絡。但是華為作為世界上領先的5G技術公司，卻遭遇以美國為首的西方多個國家的打壓。\n英國，曾經在今年年初宣佈允許華為參與英國的5G網絡建設，現在首相約翰遜也因各方壓力有改變態度的跡象。\n華為輪值董事長郭平說，現在的華為是努力在尋找怎麼能夠存活。他說求生存世華為現在的主題詞。\n根據德國專利數據公司Iplytics發佈的關於5G標凖專利註冊的調查報告，截至2020年元旦，全球21500多個5G標凖專利中，華為的專利註冊數量世界第一，有3400多個，其次是三星、中興，LG電子、諾基亞和愛立信。\n美國網絡安全問題評論員扎克·多夫曼（Zak Doffman）撰文說，美國允許業界公司與華為共同制定5G標凖，是「非常關鍵的改變，是對華為全球5G標凖影響力的承認，也是對華為大量專利和研發大投入的承認。同時美國的表明，不希望製造一個5G缺口，威脅我們今後旅行都依賴的5G技術國際兼容局面。」\n美國的這一新規定最直接的受益者可能是美國的通訊技術企業，他們將能參與標凖制定，與中國的技術競爭；但分析人士指出，新規定可能更反應出這樣一個現實，那就是制訂全球5G標凖必須與中國華為打交道。\n果真如此，這將給華為帶來什麼呢？是進一步的封殺還是開放？"

  chinese_body: "中國和英國的科學家稱，他們再次監測到距離地球6億光年遠的一個超級黑洞的「心跳」。據中英科學家證實，10數年後這一黑洞的心跳仍然存在，並依然強健有力。\n科學家首次發現這一黑洞的心跳是在2007年。這一黑洞位於距地球約6億光年的一個名叫RE J1034+396星系的中心。\n科學家十幾年前第一次觀測到這一黑洞「心跳」時，每隔一小時進行一次記錄。2011年，由於觀測衛星的視線受到太陽的遮擋，不得不放棄監測。\n天文學家說，這是他們在黑洞中所觀測到的歷時最久的心跳。\n何為黑洞「心跳」？\n所謂黑洞「心跳」，指的是當物質落入黑洞，或者說當黑洞在吸入這些物質時會釋放出巨大能量，同時伴有節奏性及週期性震蕩信號，就彷彿是心跳一樣。\n當然，黑洞的心跳跟我們所理解的人的心跳完全不同。\n黑洞心跳有助於科學家了解關於其體積大小，以及其周圍空間的更多信息。\n同時，通過研究黑洞每次跳動之間的間隔，科學家也可以掌握更多有關黑洞附近物質的信息，例如，它的大小等。\n黑洞心跳的意義\n2018年，中國科學院國家天文台高能天體物理團組和英國杜倫大學的科學家們，利用歐洲空間局XMM-牛頓衛星（X射線天文衛星）重新找到了這顆黑洞的心跳。\n經過詳細的數據分析，這一跨國團隊最終確認，RE J1034+396的X射線震蕩信號仍然存在，並且比10年前更強了。\n他們認為，這是目前觀測到的超大質量黑洞心跳信號的最長持續時間。\n中國方面的主要研究作者金馳川表示，最新發現證明，由超大質量黑洞產生的此類信號不僅強並且持久。\n金馳川還表示，這為科學家提供了進一步研究這一心跳信號性質和起源的最佳機會。\n據目前的科學理論認為，黑洞的引力非常強，以至於一切物質，包括光在內，一旦陷入其中就無法逃脫。\n黑洞是具有無法想象的可怕力量的宇宙真空，僅銀河系中就有大約1億個黑洞。\n科學家下一步要對他們的發現進行更深入的研究，並希望能夠把它同我們星系的黑洞進行比較。"

  chinese_body: "中國和澳大利亞關係持續惡化。中國繼對澳大利亞大麥徵稅、禁止部分牛肉進口後，近日又連續發佈旅遊安全提醒和留學預警。\n澳大利亞政府此前曾呼籲針對新冠肺炎疫情的源頭展開獨立調查。有學者認為，中方的舉措是針對澳大利亞提議的「懲罰」，中澳關係進入1972年建交以來最低點。   \n接連預警\n6月5日，中國文化與旅遊部發佈通告稱，受到新冠肺炎疫情影響，澳大利亞國內對華人和亞裔的種族歧視言行和暴力行為現象明顯上升，提醒中國遊客切勿前往澳大利亞旅遊。\n澳大利亞旅遊部長伯明翰（Simon Birmingham）則表示，中國關於遊客面臨危險的說法「沒有事實依據」。\n6月9日，中國教育部又發佈通告，要求留學人員謹慎選擇赴澳或返澳學習，引用的理由仍然是疫情與澳大利亞針對亞裔的歧視事件。\n澳大利亞教育部長提恩（Dan Tehan）隨後回應，澳大利亞是一個「成功的多元文化社會」，提供「世界級的教育」。他還提到澳大利亞在控制新冠疫情取得一定進展，這意味著澳大利亞是目前對國際學生來說世界上最安全的國家之一。\n這些接連預警暗示，新冠疫情期間，中國和澳大利亞的緊張關係再度升級。\n中國的反擊？\n澳大利亞政府在4月呼籲國際社會，針對新冠肺炎疫情的源頭展開獨立調查。這項提議似乎激怒了中國。\n隨後，中國當局對澳大利亞採取了兩項措施，包括5月宣佈禁止四家澳大利亞牛肉出口商向中國出口牛肉，據稱這四家佔澳大利亞向中國出口牛肉總額的35%；並對澳大利亞大麥出口徵收80.5%的反傾銷以及反補貼稅。\n有分析人士認為，這是北京對澳大利亞的「懲罰」。4月底，中國駐澳大利亞大使成競業接受澳大利亞媒體訪問時表示，澳大利亞對病毒起源展開調查的提議是「政治操弄」，是要對中國「展開政治攻擊」，並表示，中國民眾對澳大利亞的行為感到不滿和失望。\n「從長遠看，如果這種情緒繼續惡化，人們就會想，我們為何要去這樣一個對中國如此不友好的國家呢？家長也許會想為什麼一定要送孩子到這樣一個不友好、甚至懷有敵意的國家去學習呢？所以這取決於公眾的選擇。人們可能還會想，為什麼我們要喝澳大利亞葡萄酒、吃澳大利亞牛肉呢？為什麼不能換成別的呢？」成競業說。\n西澳大學政治與國際關係副教授陳傑認為，中國政府最新發佈的旅遊和留學警告是中國當局前段時間對澳懲罰動作的繼續，誇大了澳大利亞對華人或亞洲人的歧視。\n「前不久澳大利亞倡導對新冠肺炎起源的調查， 並和美國一起支持台灣參與世界衛生大會， 受到北京戰狼外交的懲罰，中國對澳大利亞大麥進口強行徵稅80%，並停止進口澳大利亞牛肉。由於澳大利亞並沒有因此而改變態度，所以北京再來一次懲罰，就是針對留學和旅遊。其實，這個脈絡是很清楚的。」陳傑對BBC中文表示。\n「建交來關係最低點」\n對於中國的警告，澳大利亞總理莫里森（Scott Morrison）則明確回應稱，澳大利亞不會因為中國的「脅迫」而改變其價值觀。\n但中國外交部發言人華春瑩表示，中方有關部門是基於大量事實才發佈赴澳大利亞的旅遊提醒和留學預警，「不知澳領導人所謂『脅迫』從何而來？為什麼要把這與『價值觀』拉扯在一起？」\n美國巴克內爾大學政治學與國際關係教授朱志群對BBC中文指出，中澳關係進入1972年建交以來最低點。    \n他認為，中澳關係惡化跟國際局勢變化有關，尤其是中美競爭白熱化，而且最近澳大利亞在諸多問題上包括南海、香港、人權和新冠病毒等明顯與中國政府立場相左。\n「其它國家都不希望在中美之間選邊，但很難。另一方面，中國現在主動出擊，以所謂『戰狼外交』應對其他國家的對華不友好的政策。 」他說。\n最近幾年，中澳關係曾發生數起紛爭。\n2018年6月，澳大利亞通過反外國干預法案，被認為是劍指中國。2018年8月，澳大利亞以國家安全理由，禁止華為參與5G網絡建設，進一步影響了兩國關係。同年，也有澳大利亞媒體報道稱中國共產黨過去十多年\"滲透\"澳大利亞各主要政黨，增加自己對這些政黨的影響力。\n2019年7月，澳大利亞昆士蘭大學支持反送中示威的香港留學生舉行集會時，與來自中國大陸的留學生發生衝突。支持香港的示威者高喊「自由香港」，而中國大陸留學生則高唱國歌《義勇軍進行曲》。\n隨後中國駐布里斯班總領館發表聲明稱：「極少數別有用心的人在澳大利亞昆士蘭大學進行反華分裂活動，引起包括大陸和香港在內的中國留學生的憤慨和抗議。」中國駐布里斯班總領館還「肯定中國留學生自發的愛國行為，堅決反對任何分裂國家的言行，反對一些人借上述事件製造中國大陸和香港學生的對立，煽動反華情緒。」\n對中國領事館官員的講話，澳大利亞外長佩恩警告說,不會容忍在澳大利亞的外交官干涉言論自由。\n澳大利亞籍華人、時政評論人楊恆均涉嫌間諜犯罪案也曾引發兩國口角。今年3月，該案在北京偵查終結，移送到檢察院審查起訴。澳大利亞外交部長佩恩（Marise Payne）發表聲明稱，澳大利亞政府強烈反對中國當局以涉嫌間諜罪對澳大利亞公民和學者楊恆軍博士（楊軍博士）提出正式起訴。\n而中國外交部發言人耿爽稱，澳大利亞籍人員楊恆均涉嫌從事危害中華人民共和國國家安全的犯罪活動，敦促澳方尊重中國的司法主權，停止以任何方式干預中方依法辦案。\n對澳大利亞經濟有何影響？\n中國的各項舉措無疑會對澳大利亞的經濟造成影響。\n陳傑對BBC中文指出，中國對澳大利亞大麥進口強行徵稅並停止進口部分牛肉, 已經對其經濟影響很大，「如果遊客和留學生不來了， 那麼對澳大利亞旅遊業和大學收入的打擊將是致命的。」\n但他認為，中國目前只是警告，並沒有正式禁止中國人到澳大利亞留學或旅遊，未來是否會因政治外交考量強行禁止仍需繼續觀察。\n悉尼科技大學中國研究中心副教授馮崇義則指出，中國是澳大利亞最大的貿易伙伴，互補性很強，在一些領域有「剛需」。近年來兩國在政治上時常吵鬧，但是貿易、旅遊行業以及教育行業等方面的交往仍然穩步增長。\n他表示，這些領域在新冠疫情中受到重創，很可能再也恢復不到以前的水平。\n中國是澳大利亞最大的貿易伙伴，還是澳大利亞最大的遊客來源地。澳大利亞旅遊局中國區總經理胡敬雯2019年9月透露，過去12個月，中國赴澳遊客已達140萬，消費達到120億澳幣，是排第三位的英國遊客的3倍。\n中國也是澳大利亞最大的留學生來源國。澳大利亞官方數據顯示，2019年澳大利亞有國際學生超過75萬人，其中中國學生佔37.3%。悉尼大學教授巴伯恩斯（Salvatore Babones）估計，如果中國學生不來澳大利亞留學，澳大利亞的大學在未來兩年內可能會損失120億澳元。\n未來發展\n對於未來中澳關係的發展，陳傑預計，會出現「新常態」。\n「澳大利亞會一面拓展經貿關係多元化 （比如開拓印度印尼市場），一面擺低姿態， 在新冠肺炎、 香港、台灣、 維吾爾和南海問題上不過多和美國一起挑釁北京， 但從此對中國戒心加重；而中國方面也會看到澳大利亞作為一個中等西方國家和美國的主要盟國之一， 有自己的底線， 摸到底線後北京也會收斂。」陳傑說。\n香港嶺南大學政治學系教授張泊匯則對中澳關係未來的發展比較樂觀。他對BBC中文指出，過去10年，中澳關係一直有一種循環狀態，有些事件讓雙邊關係進入低潮，但是雙方隨後又會努力恢復關係。\n「經濟上相互依賴會讓國與國之間關係更加平緩，因為雙方都會意識到，由於政治關係引發的衝突會導致他們經濟利益受損。」他說。\n朱志群認為，中澳問題的核心在於在中美競爭中澳大利亞的態度。\n「是一面倒向特朗普政府，與中國全面對抗，還是像德國或新加坡等一樣不選邊，平衡與美國和中國的關係，」他說，「另外中方也必須認識到，『戰狼外交』並不利於中國的國際形象，而澳大利亞並不是唯一對中國目前的內政外交表示擔憂的國家。」\n「所以中澳兩國都要冷靜思考如何阻止關係繼續惡化，並找出雙方可以繼續合作的共同點。」他說。"

  chinese_body: "6月初，江蘇一名五年級小學生在作文課後跑出教室翻越欄桿墜樓身亡。學生家長質疑，老師批評學生作文未傳遞正能量或許與墜亡有關，引發網絡對「正能量」教育的討論。\n教育專家對BBC中文表示，事件反映出中國需要反思應試作文教育的固化模式，重視培養學生獨立思考、批判和質疑的能力。\n作文課後墜亡\n據中國媒體梨視頻、《瀟湘晨報》報道，6月4日下午3時15分，江蘇常州河濱小學學生繆可馨上完作文課後墜樓身亡，其家長稱老師批評孩子作文未傳遞正能量，懷疑與孩子墜樓有關。\n繆可馨家長接受採訪時稱，從監控看到，當日下午孩子在上完作文課後面色痛苦跑出教室，爬出欄桿墜樓，送到醫院搶救後不治身亡。\n「一個正常的孩子，她怎麼可能沒什麼事情自己衝出去。」家長質疑。\n繆可馨母親在微博上稱，在孩子作文本看到她墜樓前被老師批評太過負能量的《三打白骨精》讀後感。繆可馨在文中寫道：「不要被表面的樣子，虛情假意偽善的一面所蒙騙。在如今的社會裏，有人表面看著善良，可內心確是陰暗的。他們會利用各種各樣的卑鄙手段和陰謀詭計，來達到自己不可告人的目的。」\n繆可馨的整篇作文都被老師畫滿了紅色筆跡。上述這句話旁邊，老師還在頁面頂部批註了一句，提醒要「傳遞正能量」。\n繆可馨母親認為，繆可馨因為這篇作文受了很大打擊，而且以前這名老師也打罵過孩子，懷疑孩子墜樓與老師教育不當有關。\n官方調查和老師說明\n但官方的調查否認了家長的質疑。6月12日，常州市金壇區廣播電視台發佈通報，金壇區區政府辦、區教育局、區公安分局成立的聯合調查組稱，走訪班級學生45名、學校老師3名，未發現當天課堂中存在辱罵、毆打學生情況。公安部門通過現場勘查、查看監控錄像和走訪調查等工作，排除他殺。\n調查組公布的通報沒有提到繆可馨這份作文。\n聯合調查組還表示，對學生家屬的訴求，學校在與家長協商處理。\n中國媒體澎湃新聞周一（6月15日）引述聯合調查組成員稱，事發當天課堂上，任課的袁老師當場批閲作文，對繆某某的作文只寫了「傳遞正能量」五個字，紅線部分是小孩子自己回到座位後，自己改的。\n袁老師在其情況說明中稱，課堂上說話語氣平和，沒有批評打罵。她第二次批閲繆可馨作文時建議：「可以圍繞孫悟空打白骨精時，一次不成又打一次，再打一次，像這種堅持不懈的精神等方面，去談談感受。」\n引發網絡「正能量」討論\n事件在網上引發討論，一些網友聯想起不久前黑龍江男孩鐘美美（原名鐘宇升）在視頻中傳神地模仿老師走紅，但隨後其視頻卻被刪除。\n鐘美美後來表示，視頻是自己主動刪除。《新京報》引述黑龍江農墾寶泉嶺管理局教育局稱，學校曾與鐘美美接觸，認為應該從正面引導他，拍一些「正能量作品」。\n有網友認為，中國社會不斷宣揚的「正能量」意即只能「說好話唱讚歌」。\n「只能說好話只能按著一條道路走才是正能量，說真話大膽發表自己對社會的看法就不是正能量了。」微博網民「RareLover-」說。\n也有網友指出，「正能量」這個詞讓社會變成了一個只有讚美沒有批評的世界。\n「一旦『正能量』從一個大眾心理學術語轉化為一個政治性的大眾意識形態術語之後，原本那種對困難、問題、不足的承認、反思和理性認知，卻變成了一種單純的對社會現實中所謂積極向上、陽光和正面的事物的單向度的讚頌，彷佛這個世界不再有任何的不足和缺憾。一個原本既有正面也有負面的多維世界，被置換為一個只需讚美而無需批評和反思的單維的美好新世界。」一篇題為《在\"正能量\"的世界裏，更接近真相的是孩子》的微信公號文章寫道。\n中國21世紀教育研究院副院長熊丙奇對BBC中文表示，老師要求學生的作文要傳遞正能量，問題的核心在於應試作文模式，只要應試作文模式不變，就不太可能會改變。\n「一個不可迴避的事實是，現在的作文就是應試作文，不是鼓勵學生『我筆寫我心』表達自己的真實想法，而是要按照命題者的意圖作文，只有表達\"正能量\"，才能獲得高分。」他說。\n熊丙奇認為，透過這一事件，需要反思應試作文教育的固化模式，推進評價體系改革，重視培養學生的個性、興趣與獨立思考能力。\n「我國要培養創新人才，創新人才的培養就必須有鼓勵批判、質疑以及教育學生學會批判、質疑的土壤，」他說。\n珍惜生命，自殺不能解決問題，生命一定可以找到出路。\n若須諮商或相關協助，請電："

  chinese_body: "中國首都北京最近突然加劇的新冠病毒疫情仍在持續。中國周二（6月16日）全天報告了33例本土新冠病毒病例，其中北京31例。在嚴峻的疫情下，進出北京的航班和列車大面積取消，當局出台多條措施控制，讓北京「自我隔離」。\n6月11日至今，北京已出現137例病例，幾乎所有病例都和新發地農產品批發市場有關。這一數據包含了周三早間官方報告的31例新病例。\n北京市疾控中心副主任龐星火周三（6月17日）下午表示，目前北京市疫情還處於上升期，不排除發病人數未來還會維持並持續一段時間。\n北京病例持續增加\n根據中國國家衛生健康委員會的官方數據，周二0至24時，31個省（自治區、直轄市）和新疆生產建設兵團報告本土新冠病毒病例33例，其中北京31例，河北1例，浙江1例。\n此輪新出現的疫情中，北京南郊的一個大型農貿批發市場新發地市場是聚集性感染的發生地，幾乎所有病例都與之相關。\n根據浙江和河北衛健委的消息，周二確診的案例均為北京市關聯確診病例的密切接觸者。浙江的確診病例長期於北京新發地批發市場經商。\n周二（16日）晚，北京政府宣佈，自6月16日起北京市突發公共衛生應急響應級別由三級調至二級。\n6月11日，北京在連續近兩個月無新增本地確診病例後再出現本地病例，引發人們對疫情捲土重來的擔憂。北京市政府副秘書長陳蓓周二晚間在發佈會上稱「疫情形勢十分嚴峻」。\n限制交通封鎖社區\n風險下，北京出台多項措施嚴防死守。對外交通方面，當局建議，非必要不出京，確需離京的要持7日內核酸檢測陰性證明。\n不過，BBC中文撥打了中國國務院客戶端推薦的北京5家核酸檢測機構預約電話，電話接通的3家都指已經約滿，要獲得檢測至少要等到7月份。\n根據中新社報道，周三北京兩大機場進出港航班大面積取消，首都機場和大興機場航班總體取消量近45%，部分航空公司對北京相關航班免收退票手續費。\n中國國家鐵路集團有限公司周三也表示，為配合北京疫情防控工作，決定自17日0時起，旅客在車站等各渠道，辦理16日24時前已購的進出北京地區各次列車有效車票退票時，不收取退票手續費。\nBBC中文致電中國鐵路，對方表示目前「有一部分從北京出發的列車從6月17日到7月9日停運」，但具體有多少班不清楚。\n曾購買未來一周北京至上海高鐵票的乘客對BBC中文說，在15日收到了退票提醒，原因是「因故停運」。\n北京市內已恢復社區封閉式管理，經過測溫、查證、驗碼、登記等四項措施後才能進入；在高風險街道鄉鎮轄區小區全封閉，人員只進不出。\n除此之外，北京市將停止舉辦會展、體育賽事和演出活動，圖書館、博物館、美術館等室內公共場所及公園景區限流30%；關閉文化娛樂場所和地下空間體育健身場所、游泳館等；恢復各年級線上教學，高校學生停止返校。\n從北京前往中國其他地區的部分人士也需要隔離，各個地區有不同的隔離政策與規定。中國央視新聞報道，從北京到黑龍江、甘肅、新疆的北京人員均需隔離；而天津、河北等地則是對來自北京中、高風險區人員進行隔離。\n北京豐台的李先生上周到內蒙古出差，6月14日，當地政府要求他隔離14天。李先生對BBC中文表示，他在隔離前做過一次核酸檢測，即使是陰性，他仍需隔離，食宿自理。\n李先生稱，他可以理解其他地區的人目前對來自北京的人感到稍許害怕。「隔離不只是為了配合政府，也是為了讓別人有一種安全感，」他說。"

  chinese_body: "中國北京突然出現的第二波新冠狀病毒疫情繼續蔓延，當局周一（6月15日）新報告了36例新冠肺炎確診病例，這意味著四天內，北京新確診的本土病例已達到79人。\n出現在首都的疫情還向中國其他地區擴散。中國媒體報道稱，在北方省份河北、遼寧以及西南的四川均出現了與北京確診患者相關聯的病例。\n此輪新出現的疫情中，北京南郊的一個大型農貿批發市場「新發地市場」是聚集性感染的發生地，幾乎所有病例都與之相關，但病毒究竟如何出現在市場上依然是未解之謎。據中國媒體報道，在環境取樣中，新冠狀病毒在切割進口三文魚的案板上被檢測出。\n當局已宣佈北京「進入非常時期」，開始連夜對數以萬計的居民進行核酸檢測。病毒學家對BBC中文表示，北京此次出現的疫情由於尚未找到感染源，形勢嚴峻，當局還需要進行抗體檢測，從而判斷疫情已經潛伏了多長時間。\n「進入非常時期」\n據北京衛健委通報，北京在周一新確診了36例新冠肺炎本地病例，另有6人為無症狀感染者。此前三天，北京累計發現了43例確診病例，打破了該城連續保持56天沒有出現本地新冠病例的紀錄。\n與之相鄰的河北省也在周一報告了3例病例，感染者皆與北京確診病例患者有密切接觸。發現病例的河北保定市已宣佈進入「戰時狀態」，防止疫情在保定擴散。此外，遼寧省和四川省也分別發現了2例與北京相關聯的確診病例和1例疑似病例。\n北京衛生部門並未透露最新公布的36名確診病例的具體行蹤信息，但此前公布的43例確診病例均有過北京豐台區新發地批發市場的暴露史。他們多為在市場工作的個體經營者，也有前往市場採購的顧客，以及執行食品抽檢工作的研究機構員工。\n新發地市場位於北京城南，作為全市最大的蔬果和鮮貨批發集散中心，每天有近5萬次的顧客光顧。目前，官方已宣佈關閉該市場，對全市的生鮮、肉類和水產品展開食品安全檢查，並突擊對市場周邊的數萬居民進行核酸檢測。\n北京市還宣佈一系列防疫政策，包括從即日起暫停舉辦各類體育賽事活動、要求全市多個年級的學生停課、禁止群體性聚餐，多處旅遊景點也暫停開放。\n此外，北京市當局還在周日（6月14日）召開會議，決定免去豐台區副區長周宇清的職務。新發地批發市場總經理張月琳也被免職。\n為何引發擔憂？\n北京捲土重來的疫情讓當局相當擔憂，官方已宣佈北京「進入非常時期」，並表示目前的疫情防控形勢「依然十分嚴峻，疫情防控工作仍然存在不確定性」。\n中國副總理孫春蘭在周日召開國務院會議，認為「疫情擴散的風險很高」，要採取果斷措施，切實防止疫情擴散蔓延。她還表示，要對新發地及周邊地區實施嚴格的流行病學調查，開展溯源工作。\n中國是新冠疫情最早爆發的國家，但包括武漢在內的全國疫情在3月下旬便已得到初步控制，大部分省份連續沒有新增病例。不過，在武漢和吉林舒蘭曾後續出現小規模社區感染，那麼為何此次發生在北京的疫情格外讓人擔憂？\n香港大學的病毒學家金冬雁對BBC說，此次疫情讓當局重視的重要原因是其屬於不明原因的社區感染，到目前為止病毒從哪裏來還不清楚，這給疫情防控增加了難度。\n此前發生在中國東北小城舒蘭的聚集性疫情， 導致近50人感染，也未找到感染源。但「一號病人」被鎖定為一名45歲的洗衣女工，後續的感染者皆與這個傳播鏈條有關。\n相比之下，北京此次疫情在一個農貿市場爆發，範圍相當寬泛。\n「還有一個原因， 這也是一個農貿市場，大家就很自然地聯想到武漢的華南海鮮市場，會擔心這是不是武漢的重演，」金冬雁說。\n華南海鮮市場是武漢市主城區的一家販賣海鮮和野味的市場，儘管科學界至今對其是否是武漢疫情的源頭持懷疑態度，但環境髒亂、人員混雜的市場無疑加快了病毒的傳播，以至於武漢早期病例中近一半都有該市場的暴露史。\n「當時，華南海鮮市場的手套、門柄和案板上都找到了病毒，但一直沒有在市場的動物身上找到病毒，後來現場的樣品都被銷毀了，所以病毒來源成為未解之謎，」金冬雁補充道。「北京疫情再次在一個市場爆發，很多人關心這是不是一個機會能重新把源頭搞清楚。\n金教授表示，新發地市場和華南海鮮市場仍有著本質區別。他說，當時中國還未禁止野味銷售，所以武漢的市場中有很多的野生哺乳類動物的活物交易。新發地市場則主要是生肉和水產品。\n他認為，儘管外界有擔憂，但重演武漢疫情的可能性不大。「中國有舉國的體制，可以施行很嚴厲的措施，加上北京一直繃得比較緊，如果有發熱病人，很快就會去檢查。只要能發現就不是最可怕的。」\n所以，病毒源頭有那些可能？\n北京衛生部門此前表示，檢疫人員從新發地市場採集的40件環境樣本呈現陽性。批發市場的董事長對中國媒體《新京報》表示，當局在一個切割進口三文魚的砧板上，檢測到了新冠病毒。\n該消息一經發出便把三文魚推上風口浪尖，在中國全國範圍內很多餐館和超市都宣佈下架三文魚產品。\n金冬雁認為，三文魚本身幾乎不可能感染新冠病毒，因為人類和魚的病毒之間有很強的種族特異性。新冠病毒主要通過受體ACE2感染人類、蝙蝠和穿山甲等哺乳類動物，這也幾乎不可能發生在魚身上。\n「與其說是魚感染了病毒傳染給了人，不如說是人感染了病毒污染了魚，」他說道。\n此前，中國疾控中心首席科學家曾光公開表示，基因測序的初步結果顯示，病毒毒株「不像是國內流行的類型」，但目前樣本數量較少。\n北京市疾控中心專家組成員楊鵬周日（6月14日）向官方媒體表示，科研人員通過全基因組測序發現病毒是「從歐洲方向來的」，初步判定與輸入性有關，但病毒到底怎麼來的還無法確定。他稱，有可能是污染的海產品或肉類，或者進入市場的人通過分泌物進行傳播。\n金冬雁認為，這種可能性是存在的，病毒通過冷鏈進行傳播也有很多先例。\n在香港5月底新增的病例中，一名34歲的確診女患者正是在一家物流公司的溫控貨倉負責為英國進口的蔬果貼標籤，她的兩名同事亦在檢測後呈弱陽性。目前感染源頭未明，但專家表示不排除包裝表面帶病毒導致感染。\n一項刊登在《醫院感染雜誌》（Journal of Hospital Infection）的研究顯示，如果未經消毒，新冠病毒能夠在無生命的物體表面附著，並在室溫下存活最多9天。\n金冬雁認為，另一種可能是外來的傳染源將病毒帶到了市場。他關注到，北京疾控部門周日（6月14日）公布的通報中，第17號病人曾在機場工作，這意味著他處於一個風險較大的環境中。\n這名56歲的北京居民在6月3日前往市場採購，6月5日出現乏力、頭痛等症狀，6月12日出現發熱後就診，經核酸檢測為陽性。他是中國官方公布行蹤的病例中最早出現症狀的病人之一。\n金冬雁表示，要確定病毒源頭，需要對市場周邊的接觸者進行抗體檢測，以判斷病毒到底在市場裏存在了多長時間，以及中國其他地方進口的貨物有沒有出現類似情況。\n中國媒體《財新網》周一報道稱，有中國國家疾控中心的專家表示，雖然從病毒遺傳進化譜繋上屬於歐洲進化分支，但並不一定是直接由歐洲輸入導致。因為從東北內蒙輸入病例引發的疫情也屬歐洲分支。\n今年5月，黑龍江省牡丹江市也曾發生新冠疫情「複燃」，科研人員通過病毒基因測序比對發現，牡丹江市無症狀感染者的病毒基因組屬於歐洲家系，與該市下轄綏芬河口岸輸入病例毒株最為相似。\n觀察：北京的挑戰\nBBC中文記者 發自北京\n就在幾天之前，北京街頭還是一派熙熙攘攘的景象。很多民眾已經卸下口罩，小區門口的圍欄也已經拆除。人們前往游泳館購置了泳衣，或計劃在不久後的端午節進行出遊。\n但突然重現的疫情讓這裏的民眾感到驚慌失措。在網絡上，很多人紛紛開始取消出遊計劃，在家囤積食物。\n在吸取了武漢的教訓後，北京當局在採取措施方面更加快速，包括在兩天內完成了對數萬民眾進行核酸檢。晚上10點，還有社區人員上門逐一詢問過去半個月內是否前往過新發地市場。\n但當局仍面臨非常嚴峻的挑戰：除了防疫本身，還有經濟上的壓力。北京的人口是武漢的近兩倍，作為首都，封鎖北京造成的損失將遠遠超過武漢。\n所以特殊的一幕是：此前中國其他地方出現疫情時，當局都果斷地將整座城市，或至少是下屬的一整個區縣調高風險等級——這往往意味著對旅行的限制。但此次北京的風險等級調整以更小的「街道」為單位，多個體制內的官員甚至呼籲「復工復產進程不能中斷」。"

  chinese_body: "北京一個市場在切割進口三文魚的砧板上驗出新型肺炎病毒，引起公眾關注。當地衛生部門宣佈關閉市場作消毒，各地許多網絡和實體商店也分別宣佈暫時停止發售三文魚。\n專家目前未能確定病毒是否跟隨進口三文魚從外地傳入，或是市場工作人員本身已經受感染。\n中國市場的三文魚供應主要依靠外地市場進口，暫未知道疫情會否影響銷情，但部份與漁業產品有關公司的股價已經受到影響。\n最新發展如何？\n北京市最早公布的44名患者中，最少30人在新發地批發市場工作。北京市疾控中心也指出，經檢測發現病毒的基因與中國國內病毒不符，初步判斷是歐洲新冠肺炎病毒變種，但需要更多檢測結果才能確定來源。\n當局追查的方向，包括新發地批發市場處理的進口海鮮產品是否本身已經受新冠肺炎病毒污染，仰或市場的工作人員從另外一些途徑感染。\n因應疫情最新發展，北京市除了加強新冠肺炎防控工作外，專家也呼籲公眾暫時停止生吃三文魚。其中，官方《中國新聞網》引述中國疾控中心流行病學原首席研究員曾光指出，三文魚食用方法與其他肉類不同，因此應該暫時停止生吃。多家北京主要超級市場先後停止售賣三文魚。\n除了北京，中國多個城市的餐廳都停止售賣三文魚或相關產品，美團買菜、家樂福外賣等配送服務也暫時停止出售三文魚。\n中國市場出售的三文魚大多是進口。官方《中國日報》的數字顯示，中國每年從挪威、智利、澳大利亞和加拿大等地進口約80,000噸三文魚。\n挪威海產管理局的市場調查顯示，挪威三文魚近年越來越受中國消費者的歡迎，2019年首三季度中國進口挪威三文魚數量增加約92%。\n中國異見人士劉曉波2010年獲頒諾貝爾和平獎，中國政府不滿，切斷了與挪威政府的高層聯繫，更停止進口挪威三文魚，多年後才恢復。\n北京最新的新冠肺炎疫情發展將如何影響中國國內三文魚銷售以及進口仍然是未知之數，但一些從事水產相關業務的公司股票在消息傳出後下跌，其後才慢慢回升。"

  chinese_body: "韓國官方稱，朝鮮炸毀了位於邊境小鎮開城的朝韓聯絡辦公室所在大樓。\n這一行動發生在朝鮮宣佈對韓國新的軍事威脅幾小時之後。\n中國外交部發言人趙立堅星期二（6月16日）下午在例行記者會上回應稱，作為近鄰，中國一貫希望朝鮮半島保持和平與穩定。\n該聯絡辦公室位於朝鮮領土一側，在朝鮮領導人金正恩和韓國總統文在寅會面後設立，於2018年開始用於朝韓之間的溝通聯絡。今年1月新冠疫情爆發後，該辦公室處於空置狀態。\n朝鮮領導人金正恩的妹妹金與正周末曾發表聲明，威脅要抹平這座聯絡辦公室。\n韓國統一部稱，爆炸發生在當地時間今天下午2點49分。\n過去幾周朝韓關係突然變得緊張，據稱直接原因是一些「脫北者」組織在兩國邊境通過氣球向朝鮮發送宣傳單和優盤。\n上周平壤宣佈切斷和首爾的所有官方聯繫。\n位於首爾的梨花女子大學國際研究副教授李雷夫（Leif Eric-Easley）表示，朝鮮方面炸毀聯絡大樓標誌著對朝韓合作的全面摧毀。\n「還很難判斷這將幫助金正恩政權在國際社會獲得什麼。但很明顯這會被用於（朝鮮）國內宣傳。」\n分析稱，在美朝關於核武器的談判處於僵局的時候，平壤會傾向於製造危機作為工具。\n韓國釜山國立大學的羅伯特·凱利教授對BBC分析說，朝鮮此舉明顯是希望迫使韓國文在寅政府對朝作出實質性的妥協。\n至於金與正的問題，他說，原則上金與正將會成為哥哥金正恩的繼承人，因此朝鮮各方都在期望她能做出點成績來。\n什麼是朝韓聯絡辦公室？\n朝韓聯絡大樓位於朝鮮邊境城市開城，是雙方脆弱關係的象徵。朝韓雙方2003年起在這個城市建立了一個工業地區，最高峰期有120家工廠，有數百名來自韓國的管理人員，管理著50,000多名朝鮮工人。\n但朝韓關係2016年起惡化，工業區隨即關閉。直至2018年，雙方同意在開城設立辦公室，似乎成為雙方關係重新正常化的象徵。\n這個辦公室讓雙方官員自韓戰以來首次可以定期聯絡，原本計劃讓雙方各自派出最多20名人員辦公。\n但去年3月朝鮮和美國峰會無法取得成果後，朝鮮單方面宣佈撤走人員。\n金與正是誰？\n金與正近年多次公開亮相，成為金正日的強力盟友。她2014年起在朝鮮宣傳部工作，為哥哥向外界製造一個良好的形象。她2017年晉升成為朝鮮勞動黨中央委員會政治局成員，但主要仍然在宣傳部工作。\n她2018年率領朝鮮代表團出席韓國仁川冬季奧運會，成為首名到訪韓國的金氏家族成員。\n她的仕途顯示她十分得到哥哥金正恩的信任。金正恩4月多天沒有露面期間，外界甚至揣測金與正可能成為朝鮮新任最高領導人。\n她近來不斷嚴詞批評韓國，首爾《朝鮮新聞》（NK News）形容，她成為朝鮮處理與韓國關係的關鍵人物。\n但礙於朝鮮複雜的官僚系統，外界很難斷定她在朝鮮官場的影響力確實有多大。"

  chinese_body: "2020年6月17日，加拿大、挪威和愛爾蘭爭奪安理會非常任理事國席位的博弈結果將揭曉。勝者將在今後兩年內與5名常任理事和10名非常任理事中的其餘成員共同定奪國際大事。\n競選是政治生活中的要素，也是一門藝術；既有競爭，就有策略、手法和劇情，就有幕前和幕後。聯合國安理會席位也不例外。\n聯合國安理會的非常任理事國成員通過定期選舉產生。2020年的選舉因為新冠疫情跟以往歷次的角力有顯著不同。\n席位的爭奪 \n聯合國是國際社會安全與和平的基石，而安理會則是這個基石的核心。聯合國網站說：「安理會對維護國際和平與安全負有首要責任。它是聯合國唯一一個通過的決議對該組織所有成員具有約束力的機構。」 \n安理會由15個成員組成，其中5個席位屬於常任理事國，包括中國、法國、俄國、英國和美國。非常任理事國10個席位按地區分配，亞洲2個，非洲3個，拉美2個，東歐1個，西歐及其他國家（WEOG）2個。\n非常任理事國任期2年，每年通過選舉更換5個席位，分別來自5個地區。安理會15個常任和非常任理事國輪流擔任主席，為期一個月。\n根據聯合國網站資料，安理會負責保障國際和平與安全，就衝突和隱患問題作出決議，每年要向聯合國大會提交年度報告、特別報告，對戰略性地區行使託管和派出維和部隊、實施國際制裁等。\n無論是常任還是非常任，安理會成員國都有權調查任何引起國際爭端或摩擦的情況，並提出解決方案。\n常任理事國有一票否決權，非常任理事有投票權但沒有否決權。\n除了參與決策和投票的權利，非常任理事國席位還有無形的優勢，競爭的付出可以得到優厚回報。\n加拿大皇家軍事學院的國防教授亞當·查普尼克（Adam Chapnick）歸納，這些回報體現在三個方面：接觸和獲得「內圈」信息、人脈和資源的渠道；在國際社會的重要性；對國際事務的影響力。\n他接受BBC記者傑西卡·墨菲（Jessica Murphy）採訪時解釋說，非常任理事國不是世界一級強國，但進入安理會之後，有兩年時間可以天天與5個常任理事直接接觸，還有其他與自己共事的理事國。\n跟這種渠道相伴的是地位和重要性。既然在安理會佔了一席之地，本國即便弱小，在國際間的地位和重要性便陡增。\n查普尼克說：「如果有誰無法接觸到中國、美國或法國，他們可以找你，因為你可以。」\n各顯神通\n國際社會和國際政治有嚴格、明確和詳盡的行為凖則。競選安理會席位也得在規則許可範圍內進行。\n專家總結，好的選戰有若干共同點，包括人、財、策略和首腦親自衝鋒陷陣，搖旗吶喊。\n據一位負責報道聯合國事務的加拿大網媒記者，斯泰凡妮·費利恩（Stephanie Fillion）觀察，安理會非常任理事席位競選的一個顯著特點是在紐約聯合國總部的「很多聚會，各種活動」。\n2020年的席位競選中，加拿大、挪威和愛爾蘭可能在策略、手法上頗費心思，從熱情洋溢稱兄道弟敘舊談新，到舉辦歡樂聚會和招待聽高端演唱會，傾注了認真和心血。\n當然，拉票也得合規、乾淨，很可能不涉及禮品袋之類容易招惹麻煩的東西。但BBC駐加拿大記者傑西卡·墨菲觀察，這三個在2020年安理會非常任席位競逐中針尖對麥芒的國家，誰都不敢掉以輕心。\n競選活動事無巨細，包括印刷裝幀精美的宣傳材料，到招待酒會上的美酒佳餚，堪稱外交無小事的註腳。\n挪威的「小意思」是給每位聯大代表贈送一枚名牌，裹著安理會會議室牆上壁掛的同款織物。\n加拿大出手也不小氣，計有賀卡、巧克力和加拿大品牌口罩。\n當然，這只是臨門一腳，投票前的最後衝刺。此前競爭各方已經在角逐安理會非常任理事國一個WEOG（西歐及其他）席位的博弈中膠著良久。\n2018年，愛爾蘭搖滾樂團U2在歌星波諾帶領下到紐約開演唱會，愛爾蘭請客，招待有關人士。加拿大2020年也發了不少席琳·迪翁（Celine Dion）紐約巡演演唱會的招待票。\n渥太華坦承花了國庫174萬美元（137萬英鎊）作為競選安理會非常任理事席位的經費，13名公務員專職負責。\n去年冬天，愛爾蘭公布的這項開支金額是80萬美元，挪威通報花了280萬美元。\n言而無信\n按規定，至少需要獲得聯大三分之二的支持票才能當選安理會非常任理事席位。\n那麼聯大代表無記名投票時是一種怎樣的心理過程？\n費利恩說，有一點應該切記，那就是聯大代表們投票前會考慮到很多因素。\n比如，參選國跟自己國家的雙邊關係是否密切。\n另一個常見的舉動是交換，比如你支持我的動議，我支持你當選安理會成員。\n墨菲指出，近幾年的安理會非常任理事席位競選中，對候選國的國際聲譽的關注不如以前，比如給了多少錢用於國際發展援助，維和行動參與程度，等等。\n換而言之，選票體現的與其說是對參選國承擔國際義務的認可，不如說更側重投票國的利益考量。\n查普尼克的說法是：我不關心你的海外發展援助撥款是多少，我關心我能分到多少。\n各種因素共同作用，最後的結果往往不容易預測。\n安理會非常任理事國的10個按地區分配席位雖然每年有一半需要選舉換屆，但過去10年裏有80％的選舉沒有出現激烈爭奪，因為許多國家有組團參選的安排。\n西歐及其他國家（WEOG）席位爭奪較激烈，因為這個板塊的成員國之間沒有組團或達成類似的分享協議，而是各自獨立參選。\n正常情況下，聯大代表聚集在會議大廳無記名投票，但新冠疫情下改為分批在指定時間無記名投票。\n不過這不重要。即使同在一個大廳坐著投票，也有出爾反爾的情況，有的國家代表事先答應投支持票實際上沒有。\n澳大利亞1990年代曾經遇到過這種「背叛」，惹得澳洲駐聯合國大使破口大罵失信的一方是「撒謊的無恥之徒」。\n2020劇情\n競選也有好壞之分，取決於競選方略和手段。查普尼克認為在競逐安理會席的競選問題上，好的選戰具有一些共性，包括在聯合國總部的代表聲望和口碑俱佳，競選經費充足，政府首腦或內閣高級官員親自出馬參與角逐。\n這些特點在2020年很明顯。\nBBC記者墨菲說，加拿大總理特魯多上半年在這件事上花了很多時間和精力，曾借2月份出國訪問之機爭取加勒比海和非洲國家的選票。\n他在臨近投票時主持了一次聯合國論壇，主題是新冠病毒疫情。這被認為是個加分的舉動，因為體現了更深入參與國際事務的決心。\n挪威、愛爾蘭和加拿大都強調自己在氣候變化、多邊主義和維持和平等國際事務上的承諾、擔當和決心。\n愛爾蘭的競選口號主打「中等國家」在國際事務中擁有發言權的意義，加拿大說自己「回來啦」，挪威則聲稱自己「從未離開」。\n新冠疫情全球擴散後，加拿大的競選口號也有所更新，強調在全球面臨危機的時刻，有G7成員參與大局帷幄是大有助益的。\n加拿大在2010年的安理會席位競選中敗給葡萄牙，引發國內政治危機，執政的保守黨受到猛烈抨擊。敗選原因包括事先關閉了幾個非洲國家的使館，對選戰一開始掉以輕心，而葡萄牙則全力以赴。"

  chinese_body: "美國前國家安全顧問博爾頓在新書中披露，美國總統特朗普與中國國家主席習近平的互動，稱特朗普曾請求對方幫助其連任總統。\n博爾頓（John Bolton）周三（17日）在《華爾街日報》上發表其新書《事發之室：白宮回憶錄》中涉及中國的一部分，披露特朗普與習近平在中美貿易談判過程中的大量互動，批評特朗普對華貿易政策「混亂」。\n全書定在6月23日公開，美國政府已提訴阻止出版。\n特朗普「懇求」習近平助其連任\n《紐約時報》形容，在博爾頓筆下，特朗普與習近平的互動涉及\"赤裸裸的交易\"。\n書中稱，2019年6月29日，習近平與特朗普在日本大阪會面時，特朗普將話題從經貿轉到美國2020年總統大選，懇求習保障他能連任。\n博爾頓寫道：「我想寫出總統的原話，但政府的出版審查並不同意。」\n不過，博爾頓仍引用了特朗普一些對習近平的形容，例如，特朗普在大阪稱讚習是「300年來最偉大的中國領袖」，幾分鐘後更將溢美之詞升級為「中國歷史上最偉大的領袖」。\n當時，中美貿易談判停擺，美國指責中國言而無信，背棄了多項結構性改革的承諾。兩國希望通過最高領導人的會談讓談判重回正軌。\n在會談之前，習近平與特朗普曾通話。博爾頓寫道，特朗普對習近平說「想念」對方，並稱與中國的貿易談判，對他頗具政治意義，是他參與過「最受人歡迎的事」。\n大阪會談時，習近平提到一些美國政治人物錯判時勢，鼓吹對華冷戰。他並未提及具體人名，博爾頓稱，「特朗普馬上認定習說的是民主黨人，並贊同地說民主黨人懷有許多敵意。」\n據博爾頓稱，特朗普隨即將話題轉往大選，希望中國購買更多美國農產品，助其連任一臂之力。\n博爾頓寫道，這番對話反映，特朗普將他個人的政治利益與美國的國家利益混為一談，這不僅反映在貿易問題上，還牽涉到國家安全的方方面面。「在特朗普當政時期之中，我很難指出任何不是被連任心思驅動的重大決策。」\n然而，美國貿易代表萊特希澤（Robert Lighthizer）在周三稱，向習近平請求連任幫助一事「從未發生」。\n特朗普對香港、台灣與六四冷淡\n博爾頓在書中稱，特朗普對香港抗議、\"六四\"天安門事件和台灣問題態度冷淡。\n當超過一百萬香港人在去年六月走上街頭抗議時，特朗普稱「這是件大事」，但隨即指「我不想參與其中」，以及「我們也有人權問題」。\n關於台灣問題，博爾頓指特朗普深知台灣與中國大陸的實力懸殊，他對台灣尤其不以為然。\n書中寫道，特朗普用手指指向他鋼筆的一頭稱「這是台灣」，又再指向白宮橢圓辦公室中歷任總統使用的辦公桌「堅毅桌」，稱「這是中國」。博爾頓寫道：「美國對民主盟友的承諾和義務，不過如此。」\n書中還指，在去年六四事件30週年之際，特朗普拒絶發表白宮聲明。博爾頓寫道，特朗普當時說「誰在乎這件事？我在試著談成一個交易。我不想要任何東西（聲明）。」他還將六四事件錯指為發生在15年前。\n在今年的六四事件31週年，白宮曾發出聲明紀念 「天安門廣場屠殺」。\n「支持」建造新疆集中營\n美國國會兩黨與國務院多次嚴辭批評中國在新疆建造集中營，囚禁大量穆斯林少數民族。\n但博爾頓在書中作出驚人的指控，指特朗普曾表示支持中國在新疆建造集中營。\n在去年6月大阪會談的晚宴中，習近平向特朗普解釋為何要在新疆建造「再教育營」。博爾頓引述美方的翻譯稱，特朗普說習近平應該建造這些集中營，他認為這是正確的舉措。\n美國現任副國安顧問博明（Matthew Pottinger）曾對博爾頓說，特朗普在2017年11月訪華時，也作出類似表示。\n在博爾頓新書內容公布後一小時後，白宮宣佈特朗普簽署國會5月通過的《維吾爾人權政策法》，譴責中國政府侵犯人權，並為制裁相關中國官員提供法律基礎。\n特朗普簽署這一法案的時機令人玩味。法案得到兩黨一致支持，但通過後白宮遲遲未有動靜，各界早前對總統何時簽字觀望多時。\n「拯救」中興與華為\n博爾頓在書中指控，多名美國官員曾多次要求，嚴厲打擊違反美國對伊朗制裁的中國通訊公司中興與華為，但特朗普為向習近平示好，推翻了官員的決定。\n書中指，商務部長羅斯及多名官員希望嚴厲懲罰中興與華為，同時防止兩家中國公司進入美國的通訊和信息技術網絡。\n然而，博爾頓指稱，特朗普並不把這當作政策議題，而是把它當作向習近平示好的機會。特朗普分別在2018與2019年「赦免」兩家公司，取消美國對其的禁售令，目的是達成與中國的貿易協議。「這當然，也主要是為了特朗普能在2020年連任，」博爾頓寫道。\n以反華姿態助選\n博爾頓還寫道，新冠疫情期間，國安委員會人員各司其職，但「堅毅桌後的椅子空空如也」，暗示特朗普作為總統失責。\n在重重危機中謀求連任的特朗普將矛頭指向中國，在書中提及的香港、新疆、科技商貿等問題上猛烈抨擊北京。\n不過，博爾頓表示，特朗普的言行是否合一，仍需觀察。 「特朗普的總統任期並非建立在哲學、宏大策略或政策上，而是根植於特朗普。」\n他質疑，特朗普目前的對華鷹派態度，會否在總統選舉之後延續下去。\n新書未出版已掀爭議\n博爾頓的新書長達592頁，被認為是出自特朗普政府前高官之手、最具爆炸性、批判性和實質性的白宮回憶錄。\n博爾頓在2018年4月至2019年9月擔任國安顧問。立場鷹派的他在涉及中國、朝鮮、伊朗、俄羅斯等外交政策態度更為強硬，兩人逐漸產生嚴重分歧。最終，特朗普稱他開除了博爾頓，後者則表示自己早前提出了辭職。\n根據《華盛頓郵報》報道，博爾頓在書中形容特朗普是「古怪反常」與「驚人地愚昧」的總統，並細數兩人之間的長期角力，以及特朗普與其他資深幕僚和外國元首的互動。\n白宮反對博爾頓新書發表，稱內容含有大量危害國家的敏感機密信息。美國司法部在周二（16日）對博爾頓提起民事訴訟，指書中一些保密信息達到絶密級別。\n特朗普也警告，博爾頓新書洩密，如果違法出版，他將要承擔刑事責任。博爾頓則否認書中涉及機密內容。\n出版商西蒙-舒斯特聯合出版社則稱，這是一本特朗普「不想讓你們讀到的書」。"

  chinese_body: "中國全國人民代表大會新一次常務委員會即將召開之際，北京港澳事務系統高官再次就「港版《國家安全法》」內容表態，引發更多爭議。\n中國國務院港澳事務辦公室副主任鄧中華星期一（6月15日）在一場官方研討會上稱，北京中央政府應當保留在「極其特殊情況下」對香港發生的國安案件實行管轄。香港民主派法律與政界人士質疑，這違反了香港《基本法》所保證的獨立司法權與終審權。\n香港行政長官林鄭月娥星期二（16日）稱，「妖魔化、污名化」北京立法工作的人「與廣大市民為敵」，要求馬上停止。\n分析人士對BBC中文指出，鄧中華的言論「反映現實」，港人不應對北京可能撤回立法抱有幻想。\n據官方新華社報道，中國13屆全國人大常委會第19次會議，將從星期四（18日）起一連三天在北京舉行。目前已公布的議程並未包括「港版《國安法》」。\n全國人大會議在5月28日通過立法決定，授權全國人大常委會繞過香港立法會，直接制定「港版《國安法》」交香港特區政府頒布執行。這部法律將把「顛覆國家政權、分裂國家、恐怖活動和外部勢力干預」等「行為和活動」納入立法條款。這引起香港民眾擔憂會否發生「以言入罪」。\n鄧中華怎麼說？\n2013年在港澳辦支持下成立的全國港澳研究會星期一在廣東深圳舉辦了一場紀念香港《基本法》頒布30週年的研討會。\n鄧中華在致辭時說：「在香港特區維護國家安全，特區負有主要責任，這方面絶大部分工作，包括執法和司法工作應當也必須由特區去完成。但中央也應當保留在極其特殊的情況下對香港特別行政區發生的嚴重危害國家安全的犯罪案件實行管轄的權力。當然，中央實行管轄的案件是少之又少的，不會取代香港特區有關機構的責任，也不會影響特區依據基本法享有的獨立的司法權和終審權。」\n他還說：「法律的生命力在於執行，全國人大常委會的立法需要賦予相關機構和人員必要的執法權和司法權，提供相應的經費保障，以確保他們能夠高效地履職盡責。」\n「同時，立法還應明確執法過程需嚴格依照法律規定、符合法定職權、遵循法定程序。此外，中央在港維護國家安全機構應當與特區的相應機構建立協調機制，監督、指導特區維護國家安全工作，並在日常工作中加強信息、情報共享。」\n不過，在其後發表在港澳辦官網的發言稿中，並沒有提及司法權，而只說」必要的執法權和司法權」。曾長年任職北京直轄報章的香港時事評論員劉銳紹對BBC中文記者指出，鄧中華到底是否一時口誤，值得關注。\n鄧中華還稱，全國人大常委會即將制定的港版國安立法「是對香港基本法頒布30週年的最好紀念」，「具有不可挑戰的地位和權威，任何香港本地法律均不得與該法相牴觸」。\n鄧中華的言論都引來了什麼樣的評論？\n譚耀宗作為唯一一位能參與「港版《國安法》」審議的港區全國人大常委，星期二向香港本地媒體承認，他是首次聽聞「港版《國安法》」該讓北京具備在港執法權和司法權這種說法。\n譚耀宗接受香港商業電台電話採訪時多次被追問何謂「極其特殊的情況」。他說：「我想跟你說，過去這些問題是沒那麼明顯的，最近這年來是很明顯的，對不？」\n當節目主持人追問何謂「明顯」，譚耀宗語帶驚訝地反問說：「哇！那去年一整年那些『黑暴』事件背後，這些外國勢力直接干預，這還不打緊嗎？」\n「你再問也沒意義。最壞的情況就是中國被顛覆，香港被肢解，這就是最壞。香港被恐怖勢力騎劫（劫持），外國勢力佔領香港，這不就是最嚴重咯？」\n譚耀宗稱，「太多猜測是沒意義的」，又指責媒體「越說越多憂慮」。\n直屬於中國中央政府駐香港聯絡辦公室的《大公報》在星期二的社評稱：「研討會一方面積極回應各界對國安法的關切，另一方面則打掉了反中亂港勢力欲將國安法變成『無牙老虎』的幻想，可謂非常及時，非常有意義。」\n香港大學法律學院公法講座教陳文敏接受《蘋果日報》採訪時質疑，鄧中華的言論反映「港版《國安法》」將「完全離棄《基本法》的規範，觸碰『一國兩制』下香港不會存在大陸刑事法律這個重心」。\n名譽資深大律師陳文敏又對《明報》表示，憂慮鄧中華的說法意味著香港法院「肯定」無權宣佈「港版《國安法》」內條文涉嫌違反《基本法》，「這套思維，法院基本上是橡皮圖章」。\n《蘋果日報》還引述公民黨立法會法律界代表郭榮鏗說，香港《基本法》第19條已清楚列明特區享有獨立司法權和終審權，以及對所有案件有審判權，不存在「極其特殊情況」下管轄「特別嚴重案件」的權力。他指責北京意圖介入香港執法和司法程序，包括可送港人往中國大陸法院受審。\n同樣是執業律師的民主黨立法會議員涂謹申對《明報》說，按鄧中華所言，「港版《國安法》」凌駕香港本地法例，意味著即便違反《人權法》也可以，國際社會對此不會有信心。\n劉銳紹對BBC中文記者指出，鄧中華的言論反映北京當前奉行崇拜權力與暴力的傾斜政策，且一意孤行，親建制陣營的諫言也不被接納。接下來「港版《國安法》」與中國大陸既有法律相比，「一定是從嚴，還有就是從「先大網，後小網」這樣的思維去推進工作。全國人大授權常委會立法的決議把反分裂放在首位，高於反境外勢力，說明北京在保護政權的大前提下，要防範的是內部分裂勢力利用香港結合境外勢力，但北京並不懼怕境外勢力。\n「去到這地步，我覺得大家不用有幻想，問題只是大家是否接受這種高壓而已。我不會再去計較內裏條文到底哪些更『辣』——根本從來沒有試過那麼『辣』。」\n長期以「社會主義者」自居，在2016至2017年宣誓風波中被法院根據全國人大常委會釋法撤銷議席的激進民主派立法會前議員梁國雄認為，鄧中華的言論只是「把事實告訴大家」。\n目前仍擔任社會民主連線副主席的「長毛」梁國雄對BBC中文記者說，他相信只要案件涉及所謂的「國家機密」，北京國家安全部門自然會以此為借口，把案件移送中國大陸審判，「最多就是跟香港的對口單位申請——香港警察也會設立國安執法單位」。\n香港電台星期二播出對保安局局長李家超的專訪。李家超稱，香港執法部門已凖備就緒，只要「港版《國安法》」公布，即可履行執法職責。他此前已證實香港警務處將成立專責部門執行《國安法》，並將由警務處處長鄧炳強直接指揮。\n梁國雄還認為，推行「港版《國安法》」始終是中共中央總書記習近平，因應處理新型冠狀病毒疫情之壓力而採取的政治手段，「把所有習近平的失敗都說成是有外國勢力干預，是香港某些人跟外部勢力勾結，從而成為卸責的借口」。\n他指出，剛過去的全國人大會議理應討論疫後經濟復蘇措施，但都沒多談，世界各地的關注焦點都落在「港版《國安法》」身上。\n香港特首林鄭月娥星期二例行會見記者時說：「我呼籲近日仍然使用一貫手段將這件（立法）工作妖魔化、污名化的反對人士停手，他們這樣做是與香港廣大市民為敵。香港廣大市民希望回復穩定，能夠有一個安全、有滿足感、可以就業、可以在這裏生活的情況。」\n林鄭月娥稱，北京這次立法「完全合憲、合法」、「合情、合理」。對於鄧中華的言論，林鄭月娥說：「因為這是全國性法律，目前這全國性法律的草擬工作是由全國人大常委會進行中，所以我沒有辦法可以評論究竟它的條文中有沒有這些內容，或是如有這些內容，它的演繹是怎樣……究竟中央有些什麼權力、做些什麼、不做些什麼，這當然要等待條文公布後，大家便會知道。」\n鄧中華是誰？\n鄧中華此前甚少公開發表涉港政策言論，但其實他長期從事中共港澳事務工作。\n根據中共《人民日報》旗下中國共產黨新聞網上所載簡歷，58歲的鄧中華來自湖南長沙。1986年——《中英聯合聲明》簽署後兩年——出任外交部港澳事務辦公室幹部，之後任職中英聯合聯絡小組中方代表處，並曾擔任法律組組長。\n2000年，鄧中華被委派出任中國駐墨爾本總領事館副總領事，2004年調回外交部港澳台司，後來官拜司長。2011年轉任外交部邊海司司長，其間有參與南中國海主權糾紛工作，包括中菲黃岩島爭端之交涉。\n2017年，鄧中華轉到中共中央紀律檢查委員會，出任駐中國社會科學院紀檢組組長，並過渡至中共中央紀委與中國國家監察委員會「一個機關，兩面牌子」運作時代。\n2018年，鄧中華重返港澳事務領域，這次轉到國務院港澳辦出任副主任，同時擔任中共十九屆中央紀委委員。"

  chinese_body: "中國全國人大早前決定繞過香港立法會，在當地實施港版《國家安全法》，引起爭議。反對者認為人大的做法繞過立法會，令香港公眾無法參與立法工作或給予意見，損害香港的高度自治。支持一方認為，香港本身有憲制責任就保護中國國家安全立法，但主權移交至今仍然未成事。\n支持一方所指的是香港《基本法》第23條，規定香港應自行立法「禁止任何叛國、分裂國家、煽動叛亂、顛覆中央人民政府及竊取國家機密的行為」。\n香港政府2003年曾經提出草案就這條條文立法，但立法過程引起巨大爭議，加上當年爆發非典型肺炎（SARS，又稱「沙士」）疫情，嚴重打擊經濟，觸發大規模遊行，最終時任特首董建華宣佈撤回草案。\n同樣是中國特別行政區的澳門治權移交雖然比香港晚兩年，但它在2008年已經按澳門《基本法》的規定訂立國家安全法。支持推動香港《國家安全法》立法的一方因此經常以澳門為例子，嘗試證明這條法律不會影響香港社會穩定。\n「就像有把刀在你頭上」\n香港政府首次也是至今唯一一次正式提出就《基本法》第23條立法是2003年。時任特首董建提出修訂香港法律中不同條文，加入條文把推翻中國政府、叛國、偷取官方機密等行為刑事化，並訂出相應罰則，以符合《基本法》第23條的規定。\n建議當時在社會引起許多討論，主要是關注立法會損害香港市民的言論自由，部份意見也認為立法會把中國大陸「國家安全」的概念引進香港，政府可以隨意引用這個法律取締任何民間組織。\n香港政府在推廣立法建議時，部份官員的言論也引起爭議，時任律政司司長梁愛詩更形容23條立法「就像有把刀在你頭上」。她多年後接受香港傳媒解釋，指自己當時「不懂得反應傳媒的問題」，才說出這句話。\n香港「民間人權陣線」在2003年7月1日以「反對23條立法」為題發起遊行，聲稱約50萬人參加，是香港主權移交到當時最大規模的遊行。\n董建華之後提出讓步，修改部份條文，但最後親商界自由黨的時任主席田北俊宣佈辭去行政會議成員，並聲言反對政府倉促立法，令政府在立法會無法取得足夠的票數通過修訂，最終撤回草案。\n「燙手山芋」\n董建華2005年以健康原因為由辭去特首一職。《基本法》第23條的立法工作之後成為香港的「燙手山芋」，每屆行政長官對第23條立法工作的立場都是外界的關注點。\n而董建華之後的每名行政長官，包括曾蔭權、梁振英和林鄭月娥先後都指出就《基本法》第23條立法是香港的憲制責任，但都沒有再次正式提出立法建議。\n他們的解釋各有不同：曾蔭權在2010年發表《施政報告》後回應記者提問時表示，自己的競選大綱中沒有包括就第23條立法的工作，而且當時社會氣氛對第23條立法的擔憂與2003年一樣。\n梁振英離任特首後說，如果自己就任特首時提出立法，會遭到泛民主派議員阻撓，令立法會癱瘓。他認為自己在任期間無法就《基本法》第23條立法，泛民主派議員應負上責任。\n爭議延續\n現任特首林鄭月娥上任後也曾被問及《基本法》第23條的立法工作，她當時表示留待「社會條件成熟時」才會提出。去年曾經有建制派意見認為成功推動《逃犯條例》修訂的工作後，香港政府應開展第23條的立法工作，但《逃犯條例》的修訂最終被撤回，林鄭月娥至今也沒有正式提出《基本法》第23條的立法建議。\n但香港政府2018年曾經引用《社團條例》，宣佈爭取香港脫離中國成為獨立國家的香港民族黨為非法社團。\n這個做法引起爭議，但林鄭月娥指出雖然香港未就《基本法》第23條立法，但不等於對「試圖分裂國家、危害國家安全的行為視若無睹」，也應利用現有香港法律處理第23條範圍的行為。\n香港親中報章《文匯報》也指出，香港法律《刑事罪行條例》中已經有訂出對當局「離叛」的罰則。雖然條文自主權移交以來未曾修改，字眼上仍然是規範針對英女皇或英國政府的行為，香港法律上另有規定「女皇」、「陛下」等字眼在主權移交後應被詮釋為「中央政府」、「特區政府」等，因此這部法律應適用於處理香港民族黨等推動「香港獨立」的行為。\n中國官方多番強調，即使香港《國安法》實施後，香港仍然需要就《基本法》第23條的規定立法。\n林鄭月娥早前也指出，香港《國安法》的草案內容沒有修改《基本法》，香港應自行立法禁止「危害國家安全行為」，因此仍然有責任就《基本法》第23條立法，但她沒有提及什麼時候開展工作。"

  chinese_body: "新冠肺炎病毒仍在世界繼續傳播。全球已有188個國家出現確診病例，確診總數已超過600萬例，近40萬人因此喪生。\n下列一系列地圖與圖表，追蹤自去年12月疫情在中國出現後全球新冠疫情的情況。\n確診與死亡病例\n這種病毒可以引發呼吸系統傳染病「2019冠狀病毒病（Covid-19）」，於2019年12月在中國武漢市被首次發現。\n在2020年的最初幾個月間，它在全球迅速傳播。\n提示：本文地圖與圖表中使用的法國數據與約翰斯·霍普金斯大學數據不同，因此病例總數相對略低。\n根據約翰斯·霍普金斯大學數據，目前為止確診病例數最多的國家是美國，佔全球總數的近三分之一。美國死亡病例數同樣為世界最多。\n在歐洲，受疫情影響最嚴重的國家為英國、意大利、法國及西班牙。\n根據中國官方統計數據，其確診病例數為8.4萬例，死亡病例為約4600例。但有一些批評聲音認為，中國官方數據真實性存疑。\n3月11日，世界衛生組織（WHO）宣佈疫情為全球大流行病。世衛通常在一種傳染病可以在全球多個地方同時於人際間輕鬆傳播時做出這種決定。\n世衛組織警告稱，我們距離新冠疫情結束仍很遠，可能會有新的迅速爆發出現，尤其是在解除封閉政策的地區，人們應為此做好凖備。\n由於許多症狀輕微者並未檢測並列入統計之中，真實的病例數字預計要比通報數據高出許多。\n法新社預計，全球有至少45億人口目前生活在保持社交距離的政策之下，這佔全球人口總數的一半。\n這些政策給全球經濟帶來嚴重影響。國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）警告稱，全世界可能會面臨自1930年代大蕭條（Great Depression）以來最嚴重的經濟衰退。\n聯合國世界糧食計劃署也警告稱，這場大流行病可能會使遭受極度饑餓的人口數字增長近一倍。\n這些地方病例仍在增長\n一些國家在實施嚴格的封鎖措施後，當地確診病例與死亡病例數字出現下滑，但在另外一些地區，數據仍在上漲。\n5月下半月，拉丁美洲病例數字大幅上漲，世衛組織表示美洲地區已成為大流行病的中心。\n這些圖表顯示了死亡病例仍呈上升趨勢的四個國家情況，具體情況如紅線所示。\n其中巴西形勢格外令人擔憂。巴西總統雅伊爾·博爾索納羅（Jair Bolsonaro）將新冠疫情比作「小流感、流鼻涕」。\n根據官方數字，巴西病例數目前已接近60萬例，有超過3萬人死亡。華盛頓大學專家預計，巴西的死亡病例數可能在8月初超過12.5萬例。\n拉丁美洲其他一些國家也出現了大範圍疫情爆發，其中包括秘魯、墨西哥、智利和厄瓜多爾。\n在其他地方，俄羅斯最近幾周感染情況迅速增加，但同時該國正在飯館一些封鎖限制。印度也出現了感染高峰，伊朗則出現第二波感染跡象。\n在非洲，南非、埃及及尼日利亞是最大的疫情中心。\n韓國似乎已經通過大範圍的「追蹤、溯源及治療」流程控制住了疫情，但最近那裏確診病例突然小規模激增，該國又重新推出一些限制措施。\n歐洲放寬封鎖限制\n在歐洲，英國、意大利、西班牙及法國與其他國家似乎已經度過疫情最高峰期，新增確診病例與死亡病例均不斷下降。\n英國通報共有近4萬人死於新冠病毒，是歐洲數字最高的國家。意大利死亡病例數排名第二，為3.3萬例，法國與西班牙死亡病例數略低於3萬例。\n但由於各國在人口規模與通報方式存在差異，比如一些國家將養老院的死亡數據包括在內，也有國家將疑似但未確診的死亡病例統計在內，這讓比較國與國之疫情差異變得十分複雜。\n在通過封鎖措施控制病毒傳播後，歐洲各國現在開始解除限制措施。\n各國放寬限制的方式與時間不盡相同，但世界衛生組織呼籲各國採取「緩慢而穩定」的方法。\n瑞典沒有實行全面封鎖，該國鼓勵採取一些保持社交距離的措施，死亡人數較周邊鄰國高出許多。\n最新數據顯示，瑞典死亡人數約為4500人。在其鄰國丹麥，死亡人數為580人，且當局下令對連接兩國的厄勒海峽大橋（Oresund bridge）實行通行限制。與瑞典接壤的挪威與芬蘭的死亡人數也在500人以下。但與歐洲其他地區一樣，瑞典的新增病例數字也在下降。\n美國疫情：紐約受打擊最重\n美國已經成為全球確診病例數最多的國家，共有超過180萬人確診。同時該國死亡病例超過10.5萬例。\n其中紐約州受影響尤其嚴重，當地死亡病例約3萬例，但目前每日新增死亡病例已經下降到100例以下，4月初時這一數字還是每天1000例。\n美國一度有超過90%的人口在強制封鎖令下生活，但現在50個州全部開始放寬居家限制，允許一些經濟活動重啟。衛生官員擔心，這種舉動會使得病毒進一步傳播。\n儘管一些州的新增病例比率正在下降，但在加州和幾個東南部州，這一數據仍在增長。\n而在喬治·佛洛伊德（George Floyd）去世引發美國出現大規模針對警察暴力的示威之後，公共衛生專家同時警告稱，公眾聚集可能會使病毒再次抬頭。\n最新數據顯示，受新冠疫情影響後，美國共有超過4000萬人失業，這佔美國勞動力人口的四分之一。\n這意味著美國目前的失業率處於1930年代大蕭條以來的最差水平。\n關於本文中的數據\n本文中使用的數據來自於多個來源。其中包括約翰斯·霍普金斯大學整理的數據、歐洲疾病預防和控制中心、各國政府及衛生機構數據以及聯合國人口數據。\n在比較來自不同國家的數據時，需要注意並非所有政府都以相同方式記錄新冠確診與死亡病例。因此很難在不同進行國家間進行同比。\n其他需要考慮的因素包括：不同的人口規模，一個國家的老年人口規模，或某個國家是否有人口稠密區。此外，不同國家可能還處於新冠疫情的不同階段。\n."

  chinese_body: "在英國、美國等與中國就頒布「港版《國家安全法》」持續交鋒之際，老牌英資國際金融巨頭匯豐銀行（HSBC）面面受敵。\n美國國務卿蓬佩奧星期二（6月9日）加入批評匯豐銀行與同屬英資的渣打銀行（Standard Chartered）表態支持北京對香港直接立法之行列，形容此舉為「政治與商業叩頭（卑躬屈膝）」。英國政界已有多位知名人物公開質疑匯豐的做法。\n而在此之前，中國輿論猛烈追問匯豐與渣打為何遲遲不表態支持北京立法，同時抨擊匯豐在華為高管孟晚舟被捕事件上「出賣華為」，更翻出155年前匯豐創業史，控訴匯豐當年如何為鴉片交易服務，又稱匯豐「遲早會為自己的行為付出更為慘痛的代價」。\n但英國報章聲稱匯豐高管警告唐寧街首相府，要是英國在5G通訊網絡發展議題上把華為據諸門外，將招致中國報復。這讓形勢更見複雜。\nBBC記者星期三（10日）邀請匯豐與渣打就蓬佩奧之評論作出回應，均被拒絶。倫敦的匯豐發言人稍早前向BBC國際台發送的一份聲明則說：「我們尊重並支持讓香港得以恢復，讓經濟得以重建，而同時能維持『一國兩制』原則之法律法規。」\n中國外交部發言人華春瑩星期三在北京的例行記者會上回應蓬佩奧的言論，批評其思想「狹隘和可笑」。\n華春瑩說：「大家都知道，這個世界上『萬物並育而不相害，道並行而不相悖』。各國、各方、各人都有權根據事情本身的是非曲直來做出獨立的判斷，並且採取符合自身利益的行動。」\n「我們敦促美方正確看待涉港國安立法，停止挑撥離間、煽風點火，停止借涉港問題干涉中國內政，多做有利於香港繁榮穩定的事情，而不是相反。」\n匯豐全稱香港上海匯豐銀行，1865年3月3日在香港開業，上海分行於一個月後投入運營。1993年，匯豐把註冊總部從香港遷至倫敦，但香港至今仍是其最重要之市場。\n「世界的地方銀行」是匯豐在2002年至2016年間的廣告詞。2019年，匯豐錄得全年稅前盈利133.5億美元（103億英鎊；934.5億元人民幣）。路透社指出，其中90%來自香港。\n匯豐、香港《國安法》與華為三件事情是如何糾纏的？\n中國全國人民代表大會於5月22日發表「港版《國家安全法》」決定草案，28日通過決定。國泰航空母公司太古集團在27日表態贊同「港版《國家安全法》」有利香港金融中心的長遠發展，是香港英資大行中最先表態的一家。\n草案通過翌日，中國人民政治協商會議全國委員會副主席，前香港行政長官梁振英在Facebook發文，點名質問匯豐「一個多星期過去了」仍未表態。梁振英寫道：「我們要讓英國政府、政客、匯豐這類的英資機構知道which side of the bread is buttered（利之所在）。」\n在這兩件事情之間，位於加拿大溫哥華的卑斯省最高法院（又譯「不列顛哥倫比亞省最高法院」、「英屬哥倫比亞省最高法院」或「BC省最高法院」）於5月27日裁定，美國試圖引渡華為高管孟晚舟受審事宜符合相關條件，批准繼續進行引渡程序。\n隨後，《北京日報》微信公號發表文章《坑客戶，匯豐終將失去所有客戶》說：「美方和加方給孟晚舟女士扣上『欺詐罪』帽子的理由是，孟晚舟在對匯豐銀行介紹關於華為的業務時，在涉及伊朗問題上做出了所謂『虛假陳述』。」\n這篇文章引述了梁振英的帖文，繼而稱：「眾所周知，港英時代殖民政府在香港埋雷甚多，金融行業便是其中之一。香港回歸祖國之前，不少英資企業皆做過背棄香港之事……目前，國家立法保障香港安全穩定是大勢所趨、民心所向，匯豐在這個時候裝聾作啞，意欲何為？」\n中共《人民日報》客戶端於6月1日轉發了《北京日報》的這篇文章。6月3日，有蘇格蘭背景的怡和洋行（Jardine）在當天出刊，直屬中國中央政府駐香港聯絡辦公室（香港中聯辦）的《大公報》與《文匯報》刊登全版廣告支持「港版《國安法》」。親民主派，被親北京陣營視為支持「港獨」的《蘋果日報》認為，這與《人民日報》的轉載有關。\n在怡和的報章廣告發表當天，匯豐在「匯豐中國企業」微信公眾號上發文，刊出兩張匯豐亞太區行政總裁王冬勝到「撐國安立法」街頭宣傳攤位簽名聲援之照片。帖文說：「匯豐也始終認為，穩定的環境是香港作為國際金融中心長期經濟復蘇的關鍵……匯豐成立155年來一直以香港為傲，並長期致力支持香港的發展……匯豐將繼續為香港的經濟復蘇和繁榮發展做出貢獻。」\n渣打不久後也發表聲明稱，相信「港版《國安法》」能維持香港長期繁榮穩定。\n王冬勝身兼中國全國政協港區委員和香港總商會主席。蓬佩奧點名批評說，王冬勝簽名支持北京「摧毀香港自治」與「違反一份在聯合國註冊之條約所訂下之承諾」，也就是違反1984年《中英聯合聲明》。\n6月4日，正當輿論關注「港版《國安法》」會否讓「六四」悼念活動在香港絶跡之際，匯豐與渣打在香港買賣的股份價格顯著上揚，但在倫敦開盤後，匯豐不升反跌，把香港的漲幅都抵消掉。投行富達國際（Fidelity International）的評論員艾瑪·盧·蒙哥馬利（Emma-Lou Montgomery）對BBC評論說，匯豐在壓力下「得發點聲明」，而市場在觀望長期局勢將如何發展。\n多位英國政界重要人物也提出猛烈批評。英國議會下議院領袖利斯莫格（Jacob Rees-Mogg；英國駐港澳總領館漢化名：李思銘）說，匯豐「向中國靠攏多於向女王陛下政府」；保守黨下議院議員奧布萊恩（Neil O\'Brien）號召英國群眾轉到別的銀行，前黨魁伊恩·鄧肯·史密斯爵士（Sir Iain Duncan Smith；英國駐港澳總領館曾譯漢化名：施志安）也對BBC表示，他會建議大眾從匯豐提走存款。\n下議院外交事務委員會主席湯姆·圖根達特（Tom Tugendhat）在Twitter上說：「我奇怪為何匯豐與渣打選擇支持一個獨裁國家去打壓自由和損害法治？這如何符合企業社會責任的定義？」\n儘管如此，英國《每日電訊報》6月6日報道，匯豐控股主席杜嘉祺（Mark Tucker）近日警告保守黨約翰遜政府，要是英國頒令禁止華為參與英國5G電訊業務發展，中國將向匯豐報復。\n中國輿論還沒等到英國對華為採取任何行動，已提出要向匯豐報復。6月8日，《大公報》與《人民日報》旗下《環球時報》英文版同步刊文，稱法庭文件證明是匯豐「出賣華為」。其中，《環球時報》引「法律專家」之言，指控匯豐充當美國政府「特工」，「設局陷害」孟晚舟，將作為「犯罪分子」受到中國司法制裁。文章更明確批評匯豐「太遲」表態支持北京對香港頒布國家安全立法，「中國市場不會坐視不理」。\n中國輿論已不止一次威脅要為匯豐牽涉在華為孟晚舟案而對其作出制裁。2019年7月，同屬《北京日報》的長安街知事，以及曉說通信、丫丫港股圈等微信公眾號，紛紛吹風匯豐將被列入中國商務部之「不可靠實體」清單。這份清單正是根據《國家安全法》等法律制定。\n匯豐最近還有哪些麻煩？\n中國官方輿論在追究匯豐於孟晚舟案中的責任時，密集指控匯豐與支持香港「反送中」示威的「黑錢」有關。但其實因為在2019年12月「星火同盟洗錢案」中匯豐銀行凍結了相關帳戶，示威者已把匯豐視為敵對單位，將其分行等設施視為「裝修」（打砸破壞）目標，總行鎮店銅獅子史提芬和施迪更在2020年元旦日被焚。\n把鏡頭稍稍回溯至2009年，當多家英國大型銀行在美國次級房貸危機中焦頭爛額，陸續接受英國政府救助，甚至變成國有銀行之際，匯豐憑著要求股東供股集資125億英鎊渡過難關，當中有不少是來自香港的「散戶」個體投資者。隨後，匯豐把集團總裁之辦公室從倫敦遷回香港，但仍維持在英國註冊。\n到今年4月初，新型冠狀病毒疫情衝擊經濟，作為英國央行兼銀行管理當局的英格蘭銀行（港譯：英倫銀行）要求匯豐等銀行取消派發股東紅利（股息）。香港親北京立法會議員張華豐將之與「金融騙局」相比擬，一些匯豐小股東也在親北京議員協助下組織起來，威脅起訴匯豐，全國政協副主席梁振英公開呼籲香港市民抵制匯豐。\n但香港證券及期貨事務監察委員會於5月15日發表聲明稱，香港證監會注意到，匯豐受英格蘭銀行審慎監管局監管，也是根據其要求取消分紅，證監會目前並無理據就此對匯丰采取監管行動。\n證監會明確形容匯豐取消分紅一事「涉及重大公眾利益」，因此證監會打破「一般不會評論個別事件」之慣例公開交待處理情況。\n同樣受新冠肺炎疫情影響，匯豐於2月份宣佈，將把全球23.5萬名員工之規模縮減，裁減約3.5萬人。但在英格蘭銀行要求停止分紅後，匯豐於4月底宣佈暫緩裁員計劃。\n匯豐與英資企業在「港版《國安法》」事件上的遭遇有什麼啟示？\n蓬佩奧的聲明說，「中共嚇唬匯豐尤其應該被視為警世故事」，王冬勝的「表忠」行為沒能換取北京對匯豐的半分尊重，北京「繼續利用該銀行之在華業務作為對付倫敦的政治籌碼」。\n「自由國家之間以真誠友誼相待，渴求共榮，而非靠政治或商業叩頭。」\n香港金融業職工總會主席郭嘉榮對匯豐與渣打的決定感到失望。郭嘉榮稍早前對BBC指出，他明白要是匯豐發表不符合北京期望的聲明，北京將對其採取行動，然而金融業講求信譽，但這信譽並非來自政府的評價，而是來自其專業服務。香港存戶因為需要使用匯豐帳戶來收取工資等因素，短期內不會大規模擠兌，但長遠可能因為對香港作為金融中心失去信心，而把存款帶走。\n中外對話總裁暨總編輯伊莎貝爾·希爾頓（Isabel Hilton）認為，對匯豐而言，梁振英在Facebook上的言論是最明確的警告。而對於一眾在香港經營的英資企業來說，他們攤上了中英兩國外交爭端，以及中美政治、貿易爭端兩個大漩渦，美國不久也可能針對香港問題對中國大陸採取行動，形成新的壓力。\n希爾頓接受BBC採訪時說，儘管這些老牌英資企業經歷過像文化大革命這樣的風浪，擺在它們眼前的可是最艱難的一關。\n美國《華爾街日報》認為，從匯豐表態到特區政府出手救助國泰航空，均說明在中國影響力與日俱增，和在新冠肺炎所帶來的破壞下，香港企業目前已到達必須在中國和西方之間作出明確抉擇的時刻。\n經常在中國媒體發表文章的英國國際關係評論人士湯姆·福迪（Tom Fowdy）在中國國際電視台（CGTN）網站撰文稱，匯豐與渣打表態支持立法，是因為香港「持續的動蕩與暴力」構成「重大政治風險」，而這是西方批評人士「無法理解」的。北京的立法「重塑而非剝奪政治確定性」，「確保秩序得以恢復」，兩家銀行自然會支持。\n前不久，英國通訊管理局（Ofcom）裁定CGTN有關香港「反送中」抗議的報道「缺乏應有的公正」，不排除予以懲處。CGTN對裁決表示失望，並稱其「有責任在我們的新聞報道中表達中國的觀點和視角」。\n其他在港外資銀行又怎麼做？\n路透熱點透視專欄作家史溫尼（Pete Sweeney）特別在意花旗銀行集團（Citigroup）能維持不作表態多久。他指出，要是花旗集團「走異端」不支持立法，中國可能否決花旗任何種類運營證照之申請，影響其參與「一帶一路」項目融資，以及收入豐厚的首次公開招股活動；要是花旗選擇支持北京，觸發華府報復性制裁中國領導人，花旗同樣會遭中國懲處。\n日本野村證券社長奧田健太郎則在接受《金融時報》專訪時說，香港仍然是該投行在日本以外最重要之亞洲據點，但目前形勢有變，他們正重新評估在香港的運營規模。"

  chinese_body: "中印兩國守軍在喜馬拉雅山脈上有主權爭議地區發生的暴力衝突曝光後，印方表示至少20名士兵喪生，並稱中方也有人員傷亡，但中國國防部與中國媒體從未證實中方軍人的傷亡人數。印度總理莫迪表態稱，「士兵們在中國邊境的犧牲不會白費」。\n莫迪在星期三（6月17日）主持各邦首席部長會議時發表全國電視演說，作出此回應。他還稱，印度希望和平，但絶對有能力反擊。\n稍早前，印度陸軍與中國解放軍西部戰區分別發表聲明，證實雙方軍隊於星期一晚至星期二凌晨（15至16日）於加勒萬河谷（Galwan Valley）發生衝突。印方表示衝突中無人開槍，而是扔石塊攻擊和揮舞棍棒鬥毆。在野黨派要求德里政府交代傷亡慘重之原因。\n中國外交部發言人趙立堅星期三稱，中國並非挑起事端的一方，而目前中印邊境局勢穩定可控。「從中方來講，我們當然不希望看到有更多的衝突。」\n加勒萬河谷位於印控克什米爾拉達克地區（Ladakh）與中國西藏阿克賽欽地區之間。印度主張對阿克賽欽有領土主權，且有時把該地區稱為「中控克什米爾」。\n這次衝突是中印邊境至少45年來首次發生造成死亡的對抗。印方指控中方試圖「單方面改變現狀」，中國西部戰區周二發佈的聲明指責「印邊防部隊出爾反爾，嚴重違反兩國有關邊境問題協定協議，嚴重違反中印軍長級會談共識，嚴重損害兩軍關係和兩國人民感情」。\n印度陸軍聲明稱，守軍在高海拔地區極寒惡劣天氣下遇襲，加重傷勢。中共官方喉舌《人民日報》旗下《環球時報》總編輯胡錫進嘲諷印軍搶救能力嚴重落後，其社評又指責印方傲慢自大是造成兩國邊境地區緊張的主因。\n國際社會呼籲中印雙方勿讓局勢升級。聯合國新聞官員金子繪理在紐約表示：「我們對印度和中國之間在實際控制線所發生的暴力和死亡的報道感到關切。我們敦促雙方保持最大限度的克制。我們積極地注意到有報道顯示，兩國已在保持接觸，以使局勢緩和。」\n美國國務院一名發言人稱，美方正「密切留意」事態發展，並說：「印中雙方均表發了降級局勢的意願，我方支持和平解決當前局勢。」\n這位發言人表示，美國總統特朗普曾於6月2日致電印度總理莫迪商討事態發展，也曾與中方討論相關問題。\n中印兩國分別如何透露事發經過？\n中國外交部在星期二下午的例行記者會上證實了中印邊境發生衝突的消息。發言人趙立堅說：「6月6日，兩國邊防部隊舉行軍長級會晤，就緩和邊境地區局勢達成重要共識。但令人震驚的是，6月15日，印方部隊嚴重違反雙方共識，兩次越過邊界線非法活動，並對中方人員進行挑釁、攻擊，導致雙方邊防部隊發生嚴重肢體衝突。」\n「中方已就此向印方提出強烈抗議和嚴重交涉，再次鄭重要求印方切實按照有關精神，嚴格約束一線部隊，不得越線活動，不得挑釁滋事、不得採取任何導致邊境局勢複雜化的單方面舉動。」\n「中印雙方同意繼續通過對話協商解決雙邊有關問題，為緩和邊境地區局勢，維護邊境地區和平與安寧做出努力。」\n趙立堅並未交待中方有否人員傷亡。中國中央電視台對外發佈了趙立堅答問片段，但外交部網站的記者會文字記錄並未錄入這段答問。\n時近傍晚，《環球時報》總編輯胡錫進在微博發帖稱：「據老胡緊急向知情人士了解，我方也有人員傷亡。我要在這裏對印度人說，千萬不要把中國的克制誤判為軟弱，千萬不要在中國面前傲慢自大。中國確實不想與印度衝突，但決不怕衝突。」\n到晚上，中國解放軍西部戰區新聞發言人張水利大校再發聲明，指責印軍「蓄意發動挑釁攻擊」，並稱「加勒萬河谷地區主權歷來屬我」。但這份聲明同樣沒有具體說明中方有否人員傷亡。\n印度陸軍緊接髮表聲明，證實有20名士兵喪生，17人受傷。聲明稱：「印度陸軍致力維護領土尊嚴與國家主權。」\n胡錫進繼而轉到Twitter上以英文發帖抨擊印方。他其後把帖文翻譯發回微博。胡錫進說：「中方沒有公布解放軍士兵在與印度軍人肢體衝突中的傷亡數字，我理解，是中方不想讓兩國民眾對雙方傷亡數字進行對比，從而刺激兩國公眾的情緒。這是北京的善意。」\n」把這些年輕軍人推向致命肢體衝突的印度政治力量要對他們的死承擔責任。印度必須停止邊境冒險。「\n「多達17名受傷印度軍人被報道因得不到及時搶救而身亡，這反映了印度軍隊緊急救助傷員能力的嚴重落後。這不是一支真正有現代高原作戰能力的軍隊，印度輿論需要清醒。」\n路透社星期三引述多個印度政府消息來源稱，事發時中印兩國部隊本來在開會商討如何緩和緊張局勢，期間爆發肢體衝突。印方死者包括其指揮官。BBC無法獨立核實有關說法。\nBBC駐上海記者白洛賓（Robin Brant）報道說，有消息稱，據美國情報，中方部隊在這次衝突中死傷慘重，而中國的政治宣傳人員顯然不希望因為承認有重大傷亡，而使得愛國主義情緒被煽動起來。\n中國方面，除了《環球時報》外，報道甚少。微博上有一定數量評論，但並未出現象印度一樣的街頭示威。\n中國央視在星期三的晨間新聞中播出了一段西藏軍區在念青唐古拉山脈南麓演練之片段。演練地點位於首府拉薩西北，距離發生衝突的加勒萬河谷甚遠。\n《環球時報》星期三出版的社評稱：「印方傲慢自大、有恃無恐是兩國邊境地區持續緊張的主要原因。」\n「近年來新德里在中印邊界問題上奉行越來越強硬的路線，很大原因是出於兩個誤判。一是他們認為中國受到美國不斷加大的戰略壓力，不願意與印度交惡，因而缺少在邊界問題上回擊印方挑釁的意志。二是印度民間一些人誤認為印度的軍力比中國強，這種對兩國力量的嚴重誤讀影響了印度輿論的清醒，也給印度對華政策增加了壓力。」\n社評最後說：「我們要對中國公眾說，在中印邊界問題上，大家一定要相信政府，相信解放軍，相信他們一定會堅決維護中國的領土主權，也會在處理中印邊境摩擦時最大化地維護中國的綜合國家利益。中國有能力，也有智慧既守好我們的每一寸土地，也不讓任何想在這個過程中對中國玩戰略詭計的勢力得逞。」"

  chinese_body: "印度官方最新消息說，至少20名印度士兵因克什米爾拉達克邊界爭議地區6月15日所發生的與中國軍隊的衝突而死亡。 \n上一次印中雙方在邊界發生衝突事件並有人員傷亡是1975年。那次衝突發生在印度東北阿魯納恰爾邦（中方稱為 藏南）一個邊遠的山口，雙方在1975年的衝突中有短暫交火。\n印度方面周二（16日）早些時候曾表示有3名軍人死亡，並說印中雙方軍人均有死傷。\n不過，當地時間16日晚，印度官方再度發表聲明稱，雙方已脫離接觸。\n聲明還說， 「有17名印度士兵在執行任務時因傷勢嚴重死亡\"，因此印軍死亡人數上升為20。\n北京沒有提供中國軍方傷亡數字。\n在此之前，中國與印度官方分別透過發言人形式，向外界披露了更多雙方軍隊在西部邊界克什米爾拉達克（Ladakh）爭議地區發生流血衝突的細節。\n中國西部戰區新聞發言人張水利大校，北京當地時間周二（6月16日）晚間就中印邊防人員在加勒萬河谷地區衝突發表了聲明。\n中國聲明\n聲明說：「6月15日晚，在中印邊境加勒萬河谷地區，印軍違背承諾，再次越過實控線非法活動，蓄意發動挑釁攻擊，引發雙方激烈肢體衝突，造成人員傷亡。」\n中方聲明還說：「加勒萬河谷地區主權歷來屬我。印邊防部隊出爾反爾，嚴重違反兩國有關邊境問題協定協議，嚴重違反中印軍長級會談共識，嚴重損害兩軍關係和兩國人民感情。我們要求印方嚴格約束一線部隊，立即停止一切侵權挑釁行動，與中方相向而行，回到對話會談解決分歧的正確軌道上來。」\n中國外交部發言人趙立堅早間也曾指責印度違背兩國達成的共識，兩次越過邊境線，「挑釁和攻擊中方人員，導致雙方部隊發生嚴重肢體衝突」。趙立堅還呼籲印度不要採取單方面行動挑起事端。\n印度聲明\n與此同時，印度政府發言人斯裏瓦斯塔瓦（Anurag Srivastava）則在記者會上表示，印中雙方6月6日經過「建設性和有成效」的會晤，達成了緩和局勢和邊界對峙降溫的共識。他表示，原本期待雙邊基層團隊可以順利執行雙方協議，沒想到中方做法「偏離了」雙方就實際控制線所達成的共識。\n斯裏瓦斯塔瓦說：「2020年6月15日晚，由於中方士兵試圖單方面改變原有實際控制線，導致暴力對峙。對峙雙方均遭受了人員損傷，而這些損失如果執行雙邊軍隊高層所達成協議，原本是可以避免的」。\n斯裏瓦斯塔補充說：「印方堅信需要保持邊界和平與寧靜，以及通過對話解決分歧的必要性。與此同時，我們也會堅決地維護印度的主權和領土完整」。\n拉達克邊境衝突\n6月16日早間，印度媒體最先開始報道3名印度士兵在克什米爾拉達克（Ladakh）的爭議地區與中國軍隊的衝突中喪生的消息。此前，印中兩國軍隊已在邊境地區陷入長時間對峙。\n印度軍方在一份聲明中表示，「雙方高級軍事官員目前正在會晤，以緩和局勢」，但沒有提供任何進一步的細節。\n中印兩國從5月以來便在兩國邊境的西段實控線附近陷入緊張對峙，具體地點包括加勒萬河谷（Galwan valley）到班公錯一帶，這正是兩國在1962年進行戰爭的地方，兩國均集結了數以千計的士兵。\n中國《環球時報》報道稱，中方已就該事件向印方提出「嚴正交涉」。\n該地區的一名印度軍官對法新社說，雙方沒有發生槍擊事件，死者中包括一名上校。\n「沒有開火，沒有使用槍支，而是激烈的肢體衝突，」這名不願透露姓名的軍官說。\n印度陸軍在修改後的聲明中提到「雙方都有人員傷亡」，但到目前為止，中國沒有發佈中方人員情況的信息。\n印度和中國有著超過3440公里（2100英里）的邊境線，但兩國對大部分邊界都有不同看法。兩國邊境巡邏人員經常發生衝突，偶爾會發生混戰，但雙方都堅稱40年來沒有發射過子彈。\n作為世界上規模最大的兩支軍隊，兩國的軍隊在很多地方都沿著中印實際控制線對峙，但拉達克地區的分界線非常模糊，包括河流、湖泊和雪山等險峻的地形意味著士兵之間的分界線經常會發生變化，他們可能發生對抗。\n據信，這是印中雙方對峙以來第一次出現人員傷亡。中印此前在1962年進行戰爭，當時印度遭受了屈辱性的失敗。\n印度指責中國佔領了該國3.8萬平方公里的領土。過去30年的幾輪談判中，雙方都未能解決邊界爭端。\n今年5月，數十名印度和中國士兵在印度東北部錫金邦邊境發生肢體衝突。2017年，兩國也曾在該地區附近發生衝突，原因是中國試圖修建一條穿越爭議高原的邊境公路。\n預計印度軍方不久將向記者發表講話，提供有關這一事件的更多信息。\n不久前曾進行談判\n在6月6日，中國和印度的軍方高級人員還曾在拉達克會面，商討解決雙方持續在喜馬拉雅山邊界地區進行的對峙。兩國當時表示，雙方同意通過談判妥善解決這場世界屋脊上的危機。\n中國外交部在6月8日表示，中印兩軍6月6日在摩爾多邊境會談點舉行了「軍長級會談」，就解決近期邊境危機進行了磋商。她稱，雙方「有意願通過談判協商妥善解決有關問題」。此前一天，印度外交部也發佈聲明，表示會面是在「和睦和積極的氣氛中進行的」。\n中印兩國的緊張對峙發生在海拔超過4300米的喜馬拉雅山脈地區。不久前，印度曾在邊境一帶擴大公路網絡與基礎設施，但這似乎激怒了中國，北京隨後加強了在該地區的活動。有報道指，中國軍隊越過了實際控制線數公里。\n印度媒體報道稱，參與會談的是駐扎在列城的印度第14軍司令哈林德·辛格（Harinder Singh）中將與中國南疆軍區司令柳林少將，會談持續了近7個小時。\n《印度斯坦時報》（Hindustan Times）報道稱，雙方均預料解決過程將非常漫長，但兩國同意，軍方不應允許實控線的局勢升級。\n此前有報道稱，兩軍在對峙中曾發生零星但相當暴力的衝突。士兵們通過石頭、木棍進行戰鬥，造成雙方數十名士兵受傷。\n如今，雙方士兵都在該地區安營駐扎，他們都指責是對方侵入自己的領土。\n在談判當天，中國官方媒體播出了中國軍隊組織大規模「整建制跨區域投送」演習的畫面。報道說，利用民航、鐵路、物流多個渠道，中國在幾個小時內就將數千名官兵和大量武器裝備從中部的湖北省轉運到西北高原地區。\nBBC印度事務在線記者比斯瓦斯（Soutik Biswas）分析認為，在過去數天內，印度媒體一直在報導雙方軍隊逐漸從對峙地點後撤、以及緊張局勢有所緩和的消息，因此突然傳來暴力衝突和三名士兵被打死的新聞出人意料。\n不管最終結果如何，事件很可能在印度國內再度掀起一波反中國情緒。對於已經面臨疫情泛濫和經濟困乏巨大難題等內憂的莫迪政府來說，這無疑又增加了外交與安全的外患挑戰。"

  chinese_body: "英國媒體近日用較大篇幅報導了印中邊界軍事對峙，最新發生的大規模士兵傷亡事件，以及隨之而來的各方反應。\n《衛報》和《金融時報》率先援引印度媒體，披露了一些造成印中兩國士兵傷亡的衝突細節。\n高山之巔的夜戰\n《衛報》援引印度媒體的消息稱，印中雙方士兵多數傷亡都是由於「失足」造成的。《衛報》在6月17日的報道中說，均未攜帶槍支的印中雙方士兵在陡峭的山脊上用拳腳、鐵棍和石塊相互攻擊，導致很多士兵失足墜落，造成嚴重傷亡。\n報道還提及印度總理莫迪在事件發生後的首次公開表態。莫迪表示，印度士兵不會「枉死」；他還表示，印度將捍衛「每一寸領土，每一塊石頭」。\n《衛報》也指出，中方反駁了印方的指控，並指責印度違反協議在先；北京還要求德里約束前線部隊。\n《金融時報》也在17日的報道中說，儘管北京迄今為止還沒有證實中國軍隊是否有人員傷亡，不過報道援引印度方面的消息稱，雙方士兵15日夜間在海拔4200多米的加勒萬河谷邊上的山脊上展開了一場肉搏。\n報道說，雙方用「拳頭」、「石塊」和「纏繞鐵絲的棍棒」等原始武器相互攻擊，結果造成很多士兵墜落山谷，以致重傷或死亡。\n《金融時報》也提到了印中官方希望和平解決糾紛的言論，以及雙方「保衛國土、寸土不讓」的公眾表述。\n英媒三類分析意見\n在報道印中邊界衝突同時，多數英國媒體紛紛訪問專家學者，對事態進行點評。\n各方分析意見基本可以歸納成批中、中立和恐慌三大類。 \n第一類，也是數量相對居多的評論，是批評中方近年來的「擴張性」國際戰略和動作，造成從南海、台海、香港到中印邊界的緊張局勢。英國多數主流媒體（廣電、報紙等）近日的評論都含有類似內容。\n第二類，相對中立性的評論多出現在面對比較專業受眾群的諸如《經濟學人》等期刊上，認為中印雙方近年來政經軍事實力變化和美印關係近來的改善，可能引發了決策層的一些誤判；這類分析認為，雙方現任領導人對內對外都推行較為激進的政策，導致平靜了幾十年的邊境線矛盾開始升溫。\n第三類，基本屬於小報和非主流社交媒體平台，開始渲染第三次世界大戰「即將來臨」。英國的《每日快報》近日就有類似煽情的文章。\n儘管有一些媒體預測中印兩國間可能爆發更多、更大規模衝突，但是多數英國媒體報道相對比較謹慎，認為印中衝突進一步擴大化的可能性不大，但是雙方敵對情緒很難在短時間內降溫，而兩國關係中長期發展也將蒙上陰霾。"
