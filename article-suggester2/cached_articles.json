  chinese_body: "〔體育中心／綜合報導〕火腿隊在19日開幕戰派出王牌有原航平先發，不料出師不利吞下敗仗，日本球評里崎智也分析，火腿此役勝敗分歧點就是在王柏融的覺悟不夠，還有19歲三壘手野村佑希的經驗不足。\n里崎智也表示，火腿在2局上原有機會先馳得點，該半局無人出局中田翔率先攻佔二壘，但下一棒的王柏融2好1壞時面對一記變速球揮空三振，里崎表示，「可以看出王柏融沒有想辦法，感覺不到他至少也要把中田翔推進到三壘的意識、看不見他打席有想往右半邊打的準備。」\n里崎表示，反觀在第4局西武隊連續安打攻佔無人出局一二壘有人，森友哉選到四壞球保送，在這個打席可以看到森也是在球數2好1壞，從原本的高抬腿改變打法，準確擊球率變高，很好地傳達出想接續到下一個打者的意圖。\n里崎還指出此役先發三壘的19歲小將野村佑希出現守備的準備不足問題，這些都是沒有幫到王牌有原航平的忙。\n王柏融開季至今3場出賽共計9打數敲出1支安打，吞下3次三振，打擊率.111。"

  chinese_body: "〔體育中心／綜合報導〕29歲的左投手巴努耶洛斯（Manny Bañuelos）將要加盟富邦悍將，今日《MLBTR》也在網站上報導此事，而這位前洋基隊農場陣中備受期待的大物投手，卻讓網友感嘆，又是一個被媒體誇大的洋基新秀。\n巴努耶洛斯在2008年與洋基隊簽下合約，到了2011年他靠著好表現登上3A，成為了《棒球美國》評價的百大新秀第41名，隔年更是一舉登上《棒球美國》、大聯盟與《Baseball Prospectus》的百大新秀排行當中，分別被列為29、13與29名，前景一片看好。\n想不到他卻在2012年開了TJ手術，從此表現跌宕起伏，好不容易在2015年於勇士隊初登大聯盟，卻僅繳出26.1局，防禦率5.13的成績，隨後便回到了小聯盟，好不容易於2018年在道奇隊繳出好表現後被交易到白襪隊，去年重返大聯盟，主投50.2局被敲12發全壘打失掉39分，防禦率6.93，送出44K，投出33次保送。\n《MLBTR》在介紹中指出，這位當年備受推崇的前洋基大物投手，因為傷勢的因素使他的生涯遭遇挫折，他在3A的表現也缺乏穩定性，這也讓他短暫的大聯盟生涯就此結束，未來將會前往悍將，與前大聯盟選手胡金龍、倪福德與索沙一同奮戰。\n網友提到，巴努耶洛斯又是一個被媒體過度吹捧的洋基新秀，甚至有可能是近10年來最被高估的洋基新秀之一。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者鍾智凱／台北報導〕眼科女醫黃宥嘉曾嫁豪門，前婆婆曾用尿布砸她臉，嗆她「破麻、垃圾」，還有子宮爛，日前她上《這！不是新聞》淚訴自己孩子患有先天食道閉鎖，求助美國知名食道閉鎖手術中心，被開價3000萬台幣。\n黃宥嘉指出台灣健保可議之處，她表示該手術美國開價實在太高，因此轉而求助日本東大附屬病院，對方開價100萬台幣，且上述價格不包括超長的ICU住院費用，也不保證病人會完全好，最終她選擇在林口長庚開刀，「健保給付醫院多少點數呢？不是醫生喔，3萬6。」主持人陳斐娟驚詫：「在國外收3000萬的，台灣只給醫院3萬6？」"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕中國人最愛吃的小龍蝦，價格出現暴跌，跟去年同期相比，已接近腰斬價，最慘的是湖北荊州、潛州一帶的主要產地，街邊甚至出現2～4錢重量的小龍蝦低至每斤4元人民幣（下同，約0.5公斤16.8元台幣），出現小龍蝦棄養潮。\n中國小龍蝦繁華已過？《中國新聞周刊》報導，「去年100元嘗個鮮，今年100元能吃飽。」，中國水產養殖網監測數據顯示，5月以來，全國小龍蝦市價均出現不同程度下滑，在湖北、江蘇、上海、成都、長沙等地水產市場，2～4錢重量的小龍蝦價格一度跌至6 ～7元每斤（約0.5公斤25.2~29.4元台幣），相比去年同期15～18元每斤（約0.5公斤63~75.6元台幣）的行情，市價已腰斬。\n但是，9錢重以上的大規格小龍蝦市價卻一路上漲，甚至高達42元每斤（約0.5公斤 176.4元台幣）。小龍蝦按照重量分為2～4錢、4～6錢、6～8錢、9錢以上等級別，隨著重量而形成的價格級差不斷拉大，幾乎形成蝦每大一級，價格翻一倍的走勢。\n但問題是，中國養殖小龍蝦絕大部分都是小型小龍蝦，以致今年絕大多數的小龍蝦養殖戶幾乎血本無歸，今年五一期間，2~4錢小龍蝦塘口甚至賣到0.5～3元/斤（約0.5公斤2.1~至12.6元台幣），連成本都沒有，價格來到近年新低，賣的越多，賠的越多，有的根本連賣都賣不掉，直接棄養，潛江市一帶大多是蝦稻養殖，農民為稻田找活路，爆出大量小龍蝦棄養潮。\n據農業農村部漁業漁政管理局發布的數據，2018年是中國小龍蝦最興盛的一年，產值達到3690億元（約1.55兆台幣），同比增長37.5%，全國總產量一路猛增至163.87萬噸，增幅達45.1%，為歷年最高。\n但如今，繁華已過，小龍蝦爆棄養潮，連帶使得曾經炒作熱度最高的蝦苗市場也徹底崩盤；2018年蝦苗價格從10幾元每斤一路炒高到40元每斤（約0.5公斤168元台幣），而今，也成了昨日繁花。\n養殖戶損失慘重，官商都一度出面搶救，包括送到加工廠做成冷凍蝦或是其他食品，或是電商直播叫賣，但是，都解決不了生產過剩的問題，尤其是，中國加工廠總體上仍在起步階段，產能還不足以承接今年全部的小龍蝦供給量，且有部分加工廠碰到難得的機運，趁機壓低收購價，促使養殖戶更不想養小龍蝦了，擴大棄養潮。\n市場正在調節中，在棄養潮之後，加上夏天到增加需求量，可能使得小龍蝦價格回穩。"

  chinese_body: "低收戶數也少3％\n〔記者吳亮儀／台北報導〕武漢肺炎（新型冠狀病毒病，COVID-19）疫情肆虐，但中低、低收入戶戶數反而大減！衛福部最新統計，今年第一季中低和低收入戶戶數和去年相較，分別減少十％和三％，更都創下近五年新低。\n衛福部統計，今年第一季中低收入戶戶數共十萬四一五二戶，比去年十一萬五九三七戶少了約十％，也是近五年新低；今年第一季低收入戶戶數則為十四萬三十五戶，較去年十四萬四八六三戶減約三％，也是近五年新低，平均起來戶數也少了約三％。\n都創下近五年新低\n衛福部社會救助及社工司司長楊錦青說，政府每年底會總清查中低和低收入戶資格，因此年初的統計戶數會稍微低一點，像今年第一季中低收入戶大降十％，的確罕見。\n社工司分析可能原因，第一是每年年底會做大清查，去年底可能剔除少數不符資格的家戶，但比例通常很小。第二可能是少子化影響，家戶人口少，總收入平均超過當地最低生活費的標準，但少子化逐年下降，會否造成驟然大降須再細究。第三可能和去年景氣較好、收入增加有關。確切原因仍待每五年一次的研究調查才能較明朗。\n文化大學社會福利系教授陳正芬則認為，應再細比各縣市落差、家戶平均人口數、老人和單身戶數等，這些項目和世代財富分配有關，包括年金調整也可能有影響。此外，少子化、高齡化和雙薪家庭增加，以及台灣經濟安全網的營造補強，也可能影響一部分的中低和低收入戶，政府應做更多趨勢分析和比對研究才會更明瞭，避免有需要幫助者被遺漏。\n至於年初疫情造成經濟衝擊會否影響經濟弱勢戶數變化或增加？她認為要待年底清查統計，但衝擊恐難免，政府應做好因應。"

  chinese_body: " 下殺每晚千元沒人住 國旅往宜花東、離島跑 觀光局研議中\n〔記者蕭玗欣、佟振國、劉濱銓／綜合報導〕國內武漢肺炎（新型冠狀病毒病，COVID-19）疫情趨緩，宜花東、離島等風景區國旅回溫，但國際疫情遲未降溫甚至二波再起，中央流行疫情指揮中心指揮官陳時中昨表示，今日起僅開放來自中低感染風險國家及地區的短期商務客入境，仍不考慮對境外區域或城市解封。今年來住房率大降的都會飯店業者，串連呼籲納入紓困對象；交通部觀光局回應，紓困三．○將朝納入都會區旅宿方向研議，正討論如何訂出適用標準。\n國旅回溫 一級戰區雙北超無感\n國內六月進入大解封，都會區飯店、旅館卻毫無感受，尤其一級戰區雙北最嚴重。鄰近台北車站的台北凱撒大飯店因地理優勢受國際客喜愛，去年六月住房率逾九成六，今年同期只剩不到去年一半，端午假期訂房才勉強達到去年同期的一半住房率。老牌飯店台北喜來登目前平日住房率約兩成、假日約四成， 去年六月住房率為六成五。台北喜來登表示，本月假日住房率回溫，也看好暑假檔期。\n受商務客和日韓旅客喜愛的台北晶華酒店，去年六月住房率高達七成八，今年六月平日住房率約三到四成，假日約五成。凱撒集團旗下台北趣淘漫旅五月僅有一到兩成的回升，六月到暑假平均約五、六成，比起去年同期八、九成有明顯落差。\n新北旅館商業同業公會理事長曾美絹表示，「這波國旅復甦，雙北旅館完全沒感覺」，連暑假也沒看到訂單進來，往年還有演唱會、各種大型展覽，現在全都取消了，國際旅客來不了，都會區飯店價格只能一降再降，至少降了三成，往年暑假一晚三千元的旅館，住房率七、八成都沒有問題，現在壓到一、兩千元也沒人來住，再不到一、兩個月，北市將出現一波旅館倒店潮。\n觀光局表示，紓困三．○將納入持續受疫情衝擊的特定觀光產業業者，旅館業也是其中一部分，上週已向旅館公會、全聯會等相關業者了解情況，至於要如何判定適用標準，例如國際觀光客達幾成以上等，仍在研議中，確切方案將由政院在六月底拍板定案。\n淪重災區核心 學者憂「劣幣驅逐良幣」\n高雄餐旅大學教授劉喜臨直言，都會區旅館、飯店是此次疫情衝擊「重災區中的重災區」，即便國旅復甦，也可說完全沒機會。雖過去多討論台灣旅宿已有「供過於求」結構性問題，從汰換角度來說，疫情衝擊是改善產業結構的機會，但也擔心「劣幣驅逐良幣」，因為大型觀光旅館經營成本更高，衝擊更大，若是這些國際品牌旅館都消失，不利台灣旅遊市場的國際化及拓展。\n劉喜臨表示，現在流行類出國，建議運用短期行銷策略，例如辦香港美食週、義大利料理饗宴，或將房間打造出異國風格，但能否真正吸引國人上門，就考驗這些專業經理人的創意與創新。"

  chinese_body: "〔體育中心／綜合報導〕2020東京奧運因疫情延後一年舉辦，所有巡迴賽也因此停擺，羽球球后戴資穎為了維持手感，將投入由體育署、國訓中心舉辦的「模擬東京奧運對抗賽」，由於國內找不到女對手，所以改找男單甲組選手。看在印度媒體眼裡十分羨慕，目前因為當地政府的政策，羽球球星只能待在家中禁止練習。\n《印度時報》報導指出，多數印度羽球球員目前都在泰倫加納邦首府海德拉巴市，包括辛度（PV Sindhu）、賽娜（Saina Nehwal）、斯里坎特（Kidambi Srikanth）和帕拉內斯（Sai Praneeth）等人，全都等待上面進一步的指示，不過由於當地武漢肺炎（新型冠狀病毒病，COVID-19）疫情仍未趨緩，雖然許多地方都已經開放訓練中心，但海德拉巴仍禁止球員練習，印度國家隊總教練戈比昌德（Pullela Gopichand）坦言，只要政府批准，他們就會展開練習，但目前疫情仍處於高峰期。\n內文也提到由於台灣疫情趨緩，戴資穎將參加模擬東京奧運對抗賽，但在國內找不到足以和她匹敵的女選手，因此才考慮找男單選手，人選目前確定是曾擔任周天成陪練員的林家翾及另一小將蔡傑皓。\n此外，有球員向《印度時報》透露，數月不能訓練對於職業生涯會有負面的影響，他們開放百貨公司、餐廳和酒吧，卻不允許訓練，「這令人太失望了，這根本是在和我們的職業生涯開玩笑。」"

  chinese_body: "〔體育中心／綜合報導〕兄弟昨與桃猿關鍵的爭龍頭之戰，6局上桃猿「最速男」陳晨威敲出一壘安打，不料兄弟內外野連環守備處理瑕疵，陳晨威最後直接衝回本壘，讓場邊和電視機前球迷驚訝不已。\n6局上2出局二壘有跑者，陳晨威面對投手鄭凱文敲出一壘安打，並趁右外野手陳子豪回傳時進佔二壘，一壘手許基宏攔截後傳二壘想觸殺陳晨威，不料傳歪了，球漏到左外野記失誤。\n陳晨威看到這一幕，才滑上二壘的瞬間又起身再度狂奔，左外野手詹子賢這才趕緊跑去接球，回傳本壘也大傳偏，補位的三壘手王威晨跟許基宏眼睜睜看著球滾過去，等捕手高宇杰終於接到球，陳晨威早已一溜煙踩到本壘。\n球迷驚訝：「河濱公園守備」、「這到底什麼腳程XDDD 太可怕」、「外野還在慢慢來？」、「有這樣的球員中職守備才會進步」。\n兄弟原本近況高檔，打線上週對富邦2戰才狂打26分，不料六日兩場對上桃猿的爭王戰又集體熄火，2場只拿下2分，守備也出狀況，關鍵二連敗給桃猿後再度跌落龍頭。"

  chinese_body: "小開太太迷改裝車 與同好醫師曖昧\n〔記者顏宏駿／彰化報導〕彰化縣張姓工廠小開原本婚姻美滿，但兩年前黃姓太太迷上改裝車，與改裝車社團的同好沈姓男醫師發生曖昧，張男混進私人「臉書社團」，擷取沈男作勢親吻黃女臉頰等的「恩愛照」，向彰化地院提出精神損害賠償告訴，並求償兩百萬元，法官表示，這些親暱照片難以認為只是一般正常的交誼來往，判沈醫師應賠三十萬元給張男。\n兩人貼臉合影還作勢親吻 宛如熱戀\n判決內容指出，張男自營公司，名下房屋、土地總資產逾六千萬元，張男的三十七歲太太黃女在二○一八年迷上改裝車，開著先生送她的ＢＭＷ馳騁於多個改裝車社團，由於頗具姿色，立即成為社團內風雲人物。\n張男聽到「老闆娘愛上醫師…」的耳語，該名四十三歲沈姓醫師服務於彰化縣某知名醫院急診室，年薪四百多萬的他，也是汽車改裝社團成員，名下有PORSCHE、DUCATI等名車，常參加國內改裝車比賽，拿下多次冠軍。\n法官認定非正常交誼 判醫師賠30萬\n張男展開抓姦無進展，後來「混」進太太加入的「BMW E20 Taiwan」臉書社團，發現太太和沈男大膽用照片「曬恩愛」，畫面中兩人緊密相偎，面露微笑並貼臉合影，沈男作勢親吻黃女臉頰，或以右手環抱黃女入懷，以唇齒相咬同件物品，宛如熱戀。\n張男提告，要求沈男賠償兩百萬元精神損失。沈男辯稱，這些照片都是團體出遊，大家起哄所拍，未逾越男女社交範圍，他也不知黃女已婚。\n法官認為，黃女多次攜先生和兒子參加車聚，沈男怎可能誤認黃女未婚，而親暱照片難以認為只是一般正常的交誼來往，考量照片只在「私人社團」流傳，沒有大舉散佈，審酌原告受害情況及被告財力，應賠償三十萬元，可上訴。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕不是狗屎！有民眾近日在臉書指出，在山林間偶然發現動物的消化物，味道有些臭臭的，竟然是1條赤尾青竹絲大便的模樣，一般人難得能見的畫面曝光後引發網友直呼「真的很像（狗大便）！」\n民眾在臉書社團「野生蛇相」貼出照片，2張拍攝於2006年的照片顯示，山林間的岩石地面，出現許多類似狗大便的棕色、塊狀物體，也散發出陣陣臭味，抬頭一看，竟然是1條鮮綠色的赤尾青竹絲正從接近尾部的肛門將消化物擠出，還將身體內部的組織翻出，為一般人所罕見。\n據了解，赤尾青竹絲俗稱赤尾鮐、青竹蛇或青竹鏢，除了台灣之外，也分布於印度、尼泊爾、緬甸、泰國、中國，屬於蝮亞科竹葉青屬毒蛇，共有3個亞種，在台灣，牠是6大毒蛇之一，其他的毒蛇為雨傘節、眼鏡蛇、鎖鏈蛇、龜殼花、百步蛇。\n不少網友首次看到毒蛇大便的模樣，感到相當奇特，在貼文底下留言指出「應該是靠北臭，蛇的大便阿摩尼雅味道很重」、「有趣耶，進食照很好找，棒賽中的反而特別」、「這太厲害了，第一次看到大便照」、「原來蛇大便的時候會翻腸出來」、「超酷的餒」。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者蕭玗欣／台北報導〕國旅市場冷暖兩樣情，今年暑假熱門景點的飯店一房難求，但以國際觀光客為主要客源的都會區飯店房價卻只能一折再折；知名國際飯店紛紛推出歷年暑假最優惠檔期，吸引國人上門。\n自去年中國停發來台自由行簽證後，原本九成住房以中客和日本旅客為主的台北圓山大飯店，開始轉攻國旅商機，去年九月推出的圓山文化導覽，兩個月內吸引五萬人次參加，成功打開國旅市場，去年也是圓山飯店營收首度轉虧為盈。\n轉攻國旅商機 圓山飯店首度轉虧為盈\n台北圓山表示，五月雖然國內疫情趨緩，但國人多在觀望，飯店加碼推出用餐加九九九元就可以入住一晚，方案公佈後三天松鶴廳午晚餐訂位爆滿，五月份住房也有兩千個住房數，假日平均已達五到六成。六月續推餐飲住房專案，住房率已成長至七成。\n圓山董座林育生指示，未來半年到一年，國旅就是圓山飯店的主力市場。據指出，二○○三年SARS來襲時，國際旅客還能來台，圓山大飯店三個月就虧損三億元，今年國際旅客根本不能來台且邊境禁令持續延長，勢必會虧更多。\n觀光局資料顯示，去年六月台北晶華酒店住房率高達七成八，台北晶華酒店表示，今年六月平日住房僅約三到四成，假日約五成。晶華酒店瞄準七、八月是傳統國旅旺季，將新推出類郵輪體驗，將飯店內打造成國際郵輪型態，一圓旅客出國夢想，盼吸引親子住房，也希望中南部客人可「北漂」旅遊，預估住房率可達五、六成。至於礁溪晶泉丰旅受惠國旅回溫，六月到暑假期間平均住房率為八成。\n位於台北南港地區的六福旅遊集團旗下台北萬怡酒店則推出「超值海陸饗宴住房專案」，住宿卓越客房送和牛龍蝦雙饗餐，假日五千元有找，端午連續假期訂房率接近六成。\n六福萬怡表示，因為飯店位處四鐵共構，交通便利，除了北部客也有吸引到中南部客人。"

  chinese_body: "首次上稿 00:42更新時間 06:26\n〔記者楊心慧／台北報導〕台北畜產公司將於本月22日召開董事會，北市府將提案解職現任董事長葉文忠，據了解，台北市長柯文哲原力挺土林農會前理事長郭萬清系統，但在2017年士林農會和北市農會選舉，市農會前理事長莊龍彥打贏郭大獲全勝，2018年遇選舉年，柯市府由時任副市長的陳景峻出面，爭取士林、北投區本土地方勢力莊派支持，陳景峻在畜產公司股東會前12小時拍板董事長，禮讓給莊支持的士林農會理事長葉文忠，如今葉卡到官司，柯順勢以他違反農會法遭判刑有罪為由，解除畜產董事長的職位，打算重新和郭萬清合作。\n台北市政府副發言人戴于文表示，葉文忠因涉及官司案件並被法院一審判刑，市府認為法人代表若涉入案件有損公司形象，這是市府不樂見的情況。至於是否找郭萬清任董事長的部分，市府並未回應。郭萬清受訪強調，沒和柯文哲接觸，完全沒聽聞市府要找他任董事長。\n葉文忠因被控在2017年士林農會選舉期間涉嫌賄選，上個月一審的士林地方法院，依農會法交付不正利益罪，判處有期徒刑5月，得易科罰金，全案可上訴。\n柯市府打算順勢以葉遭判刑有罪為由，在22日畜產公司董事會，由市府官股的常董，提臨時提案，解除董事長葉文忠職務，將另由市府指派的董事長接替。\n地方知情人士表示，北市府雖會先指派市府常董暫代董事長職務，但後續可能規劃指派前畜產公司董事長、前士林農會理事長郭萬清，替換市府常董後再擔任董事長，如同北農1年多前換董事長一樣，由副市長彭振聲先任北農董事長，後續在臨時董事會推舉前議員黃向羣擔任董事長。\n該人士表示，2018年11月時任北農總經理的吳音寧，也是以臨時動議的方式被拉掉，由於該動議是由當時安排吳音寧為總經理的農委會提出，吳最後接受安排，但葉文忠可能不接受重大人事提案以臨時動議提出，將主張《公司法》重大議案應在7日前先提出、並納入董事會議程，要求按照程序。\n記者向葉文忠求證，他表示沒聽聞會被解除職務的消息，但下週一若有人提改選董事長的議案，將要求按照法規程序進行。\n葉文忠表示，部分人士被士林農會的反對派誤導，為了明年3月的農會選舉，無理的想要把他拉下來，他3年來在士林農會的施政，無論是便民措施、農機借用共享經濟，普受農民稱讚，深獲認同，現在打算要硬將他拉下董事長職位，反對派在農會的選舉上才有希望。\n針對賄選案，葉文忠強調，他並未賄選，檢調單位也沒賄選證據，農民對於判決多表示意外與不解，就算二審維持原判，並不影響任士林農會理事長的資格，他不是因貪汙、業務相關的事被判有罪，也和擔任畜產董事長、公司管理無衝突。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者梁偉銘／綜合報導〕職業網壇受武漢肺炎（新型冠狀病毒病，COVID-19）疫情影響持續停擺，眾選手無球可打更加凸顯貧富差距，前溫布頓女單冠軍巴托莉（Marion Bartoli）跳出來批評，相關單位應該合理分配奬金，甚至把矛頭指向人氣最旺的瑞士傳奇球星費德爾（Roger Federer）。\n「費德爾是全世界收入最高的運動員，甚至一年高達1億美元（約30億台幣），但世界排名150的選手卻很難生存，我認為這太奇怪了。」現年35歲的巴托莉解釋，她並非要從費爸那兒拿錢，但大家應該更合理地分配運用奬金，「給生活有困難的選手多分一些，我覺得這並沒壞處。」她還強調，絕不支持取消雙打比賽，「但為何不稍微減少雙打冠軍奬金或總奬金，讓單打會外賽選手拿多點呢？」\n坐擁史上最多20座大滿貫男單冠軍的費爸，先前《富比士（Forbes）》公佈2019年6月至今年6月全球運動員收入排行榜中，挾1億630萬美元（約31.8億台幣）高居榜首，也是史上首位攻頂的網球選手。只不過，2013年贏得溫網不久就退休的 巴托莉，顯然沒提到費爸年收入只有零頭來自職業賽事獎金，其餘上億美元幾乎都由廣告、代言等贊助商提供，這可是各憑本事無從分配。"

  chinese_body: "自由時報\n中國陸射飛彈逾2700枚 美台高度戒備\n中國解放軍持續強化軍力，美國國防部去年發布的「中國軍力評估報告」統計，中共陸射彈道、巡弋飛彈的總數，已達一三四○枚至二七四○枚，對台灣、美國等印太國家構成嚴峻威脅。為此，美國參議院軍事委員會近期通過「太平洋威懾倡議」，納入增加太平洋地區部隊飛彈防禦的內容，國軍今年也實施愛國者、天弓飛彈射擊訓練，驗證反飛彈能力，並持續研發及精進既有飛彈的性能與射程，全面強化反飛彈戰力。\n詳見中國陸射飛彈逾2700枚 美台高度戒備。\n混進臉書社團 截圖「恩愛照」抓姦成功\n彰化縣張姓工廠小開原本婚姻美滿，但兩年前黃姓太太迷上改裝車，與改裝車社團的同好沈姓男醫師發生曖昧，張男混進私人「臉書社團」，擷取沈男作勢親吻黃女臉頰等的「恩愛照」，向彰化地院提出精神損害賠償告訴，並求償兩百萬元，法官表示，這些親暱照片難以認為只是一般正常的交誼來往，判沈醫師應賠三十萬元給張男。\n詳見混進臉書社團 截圖「恩愛照」抓姦成功。\n疫情肆虐反減少 首季中低收戶數大減10％\n武漢肺炎（新型冠狀病毒病，COVID-19）疫情肆虐，但中低、低收入戶戶數反而大減！衛福部最新統計，今年第一季中低和低收入戶戶數和去年相較，分別減少十％和三％，更都創下近五年新低。\n詳見疫情肆虐反減少 首季中低收戶數大減10％。\n聯合報\n波頓：只要川普還是總統 台灣在背棄清單名列前茅\n美國前國安顧問波頓新書「事發之室：白宮回憶錄」預定廿三日上市，聯合報昨天取得新書內容，波頓在書中敘述美國總統川普同意售台Ｆ-16後，指示波頓「悄悄」執行。波頓還說，川普在去年十一月背棄敘利亞庫德族後，外界猜測他下一個可能背棄的對象，台灣在這張遭背棄清單中名列前茅。\n詳見波頓：只要川普還是總統 台灣在背棄清單名列前茅。\n上帝的金戒指 全民追日\n「上帝的金戒指」天文奇景日環食，昨天下午在台灣上空絢爛登場，由於下次想再看到此景得等上一百九十五年，全台民眾瘋狂追日。台灣前一次日環食是二○一二年五月廿一日，當時為日出帶食，觀測時間較不理想。這次日環食從非洲內陸至西太平洋，整個亞洲都在可見範圍，嘉義、台東等地位在寬四十七公里左右的環食帶上，遮蔽日面可達百分之九十七以上，無論是否是天文迷都相當興奮。\n詳見上帝的金戒指 全民追日。\n中國時報\n全台瘋賞日環食 金戒指現身 嘉義旅館幾乎客滿\n天文奇景日環食21日下午登場，金門、嘉義、雲林、花蓮都湧入大批人潮，爭睹傳說中「上帝的金戒指」，就連只能看到日偏食的台北市，也有萬人湧入天文館；而位於北回歸線上的嘉義縣為絕佳觀測區域，北回歸線太陽館、故宮南院、牛埔仔愛情大草原和高跟鞋教堂等地昨分別舉辦日環食系列活動，帶動觀光效益，多家知名旅館周末2天住房率破9成，讓業者笑呵呵。\n詳見全台瘋賞日環食 金戒指現身 嘉義旅館幾乎客滿。\n港版國安法 可望7月1日前通過\n大陸全國人大常委會第20次會議將於6月28至30日在北京舉行。雖然會議議程未提及是否再次審議港版「國安法」，但由於7月1日正是香港主權回歸23周年，外界普遍認為，此次會議可能循上次會議做法，由委員長會議提請審議，屆時港版「國安法」可望在此次會議中表決通過，即七一前通過。\n詳見港版國安法 可望7月1日前通過。"

  chinese_body: "〔編譯陳成良／綜合報導〕中國正逢連續暴雨，高達24省遭到洪災侵襲，三峽潰壩爭議再度浮上檯面，儘管中國官方堅稱都是謠言「純屬惡意炒作」，不過，中國官媒坦承，三峽庫區水位持續上漲，目前已超出防洪限制水位近2公尺！\n中國《央視財經》節目21日報導，三峽大壩入庫流量20日增加至每秒26500立方公尺，相比19日的每秒20500立方公尺，增加了每秒6000立方公尺。目前庫區水位接近147公尺，超出防洪限制水位近2公尺。當地停靠在岸邊的客渡船也開始移錨收纜，以防走錨、斷纜事故發生。為了應對此次強降雨造成的漲水過程，中國海事部門也加強對過往船舶的檢查以及對重點水域、碼頭的巡查巡視。\n此前，世界大壩協會多次將三峽大壩列為「全世界最危險的大壩」，因為曾經就有遙測照片發現，該大壩有「疑似」位移甚至可能變形的消息，不過中國官方及三峽集團都回應沒有變形問題，而壩體有3厘米左右的位移，是正常的「彈性變形」。"

  chinese_body: "首次上稿 01:22更新時間 06:21\n〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕中國連續暴雨，高達24省遭到洪災侵襲，長江三峽大壩潰堤疑慮又起。中國著名旅德水利專家王維洛示警，三峽大壩的防洪功能根本沒用，長江中下游居民應盡早準備救生裝備、擬定逃跑路線，一旦潰堤，洪水將一路沖到上海。\n根據《大紀元》報導，王維洛著有《三峽工程三十六計》，揭露三峽大壩從工程論證、設計、到最後的施工品質檢查，都是相同人馬進行，無疑是球員兼裁判，官方宣稱大壩具有協調區域發展、發電、航運、南水北調與防洪5功能，並認為防洪功能通過檢測，其實根本沒辦法防洪。\n王維洛指出，目前大壩下游的湖南、湖北、江西等地都發生洪水，水利部副部長葉建春也不樂觀地透露可能會有更大洪水發生；大壩上游地區的重慶同樣淹水，發出洪水預警，如此一來，上游的居民希望大壩放水、下游的居民企盼不要放水，大壩在施工前的論證就已知道，這樣的建物想達到防洪會發生矛盾情況，對治水完全沒用。\n王維洛爆料，錢正英、張光斗等學者負責三峽大壩工程設計、品質檢查，當時寫給三峽大壩建設工程副主任郭樹言的信上提及：「實際上三峽工程的質量（品質）並沒有像我們寫得那麼好，三峽工程的質量（品質）是一般，因為建造得太快了，時間太短了。」\n王維洛強調，比起壩體變形，三峽大壩更為嚴重的是滲漏問題，壩體船閘四周的滲漏問題相當不樂觀，是施工最差、位移最大的所在，當時是由武警部隊負責船閘工程；他認為，一旦潰堤，從大壩以下到上海、出海口將「全都完蛋」，呼籲長江中下游居民應有心理準備，提早規劃逃生。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕中國正逢連續暴雨，高達24省遭到洪災侵襲，至15日統計已逾800萬多民眾受災，多處洪水泥流、房屋倒塌，而暴雨仍在持續降下，本月17日凌晨，三峽大壩上游、四川甘孜丹巴縣發電站被沖毀及爆發泥石流，令多年來就飽受潰壩質疑的三峽大壩再次面臨嚴峻挑戰。網上並傳有專家「黃小坤」發文要「宜昌以下跑」，危機疑在瞬間，不過，中國官方卻老神在在，指控這些都是謠言。\n綜合媒體報導，中國自六月以來的暴雨，已經造成華南、華中多地出現災情，西南部的四川省東北、西北、中部和川西高原局部，16日起連降24小時大雨或暴雨，17日在甘孜藏族自治州丹巴縣梅龍溝不止有泥石流、阻斷小金川河形成堰塞湖，水量一度達一百萬立方公尺，17日開始漫流，發電量兩千千瓦的梅龍發電站被沖毀。四川部份地區預計大雨雨勢將持續到23日。\n由於這個位置位於三峽大壩上游，之前更傳出三峽大壩變形，讓民眾再度憂心三峽大壩能否渡過危機。\n中媒報導引用中國水力發電工程學會副秘書長張博庭的說法，指這是「純屬惡意炒作！」，指去年已曾對三峽大壩變形的不實傳言，澄清過一輪，且大壩變形和防大洪水之間也沒有必然關聯，拼接在一起，容易引起公眾誤解和恐慌。\n另外，在網上流傳最盛的是一位名叫「黃小坤」的人士一篇文，對民眾提出「宜昌以下跑，最後說一次」的警告，中國建築科學研究院研究員黃小坤被打爆電話，他出面表示，他不是網上那位黃小坤，不知個人訊息為何被貼上網路，並強調他從沒有發表過任何跟三峽大壩關的言論。\n長江勘測規劃設計研究院總工王小毛介紹，三峽工程大壩為混凝土重力壩，最大壩高181米，最大壩底寬度126米，其防洪設計、抗震設計、建築物穩定和應力的控制等均採用非常嚴苛的設計標準。三峽樞紐工程區域佈置了門類齊全、數量龐大的安全監測設施，總共有3大類、14科目、12087支監測儀器，對工程的工作性態進行自動化實時監測和分析。\n王小毛表示，截至目前三峽大壩一切正常，安全可靠，壩基水平位移都在監測誤差範圍內，壩基穩定，壩頂壩頂向下游最大水平位移為30毫米，符合國內外已建混凝土重力壩變形規律，各項指標均在設計允許範圍內。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕今日在太平洋高壓持續影響下，各地大多是多雲到晴、高溫炎熱的天氣，由於西南風逐漸增強，清晨至上午中南部因環境風場與陸風輻合，局部地區會有短暫陣雨，午後則是在東北部地區及各地山區有小範圍短暫雷陣雨。\n今日溫度方面，各地高溫普遍都在34、35度以上，尤其大台北、基隆、宜蘭、花蓮、台東更可達36度，花蓮縱谷因缺乏海風調節，甚至可能出現更高的溫度。另外，各地紫外線指數也容易達過量或危險等級，民眾外出活動請做好防曬工作並多補充水分。中央氣象局也在今晨發布高溫警報，指出今日花蓮縣、台東縣、台北市盆地在中午前後為橙色燈號，有機會出現36度高溫；新北市、基隆市、宜蘭縣近山區或河谷為黃色燈號，需注意高溫。\n今日空氣品質部分，環境風場為西南風且氣溫偏高，各地水平及垂直擴散條件佳，空氣品質普遍良好；濁水溪局部地區因午後風速較強，短時間可能引發河川揚塵現象影響空氣品質及能見度。北部、竹苗、中部、雲嘉南、高屏、宜蘭、花東空品區及馬祖、金門、澎湖為「良好」等級。\n週二至週五（23日至26日）受西南風影響，各地大多仍為多雲到晴的天氣，但隨著西南風帶來的水氣逐漸增多，中南部地區有機會出現不定時降雨，午後在山區容易有熱對流發展，並可能擴展影響到附近地區，全台各地皆要留意局部午後雷陣雨，氣溫方面則依舊悶熱。\n週六、下週日（27日、28日）水氣減少，各地大多為多雲到晴的天氣，中南部清晨至上午間有局部短暫陣雨，但雨量不大，山區午後有局部雷陣雨。\n國際都市氣象：\n亞洲、大洋洲\n美洲\n歐洲、非洲\n中國"

  chinese_body: "〔記者徐義平／台北報導〕蔡總統第一屆任期喊出「八年二十萬戶社宅」目標，依據內政部最新統計，目前推動總戶數近五．一八萬戶，其中近七成處於興建中、待開工或是規劃中，新完工戶數不到一萬戶，不到住宅存量○．一％；另外的包租代管媒合數，只是剛好突破政策目標的「一成」。\n房產業者指出，「八年二十萬戶社宅」目標其中十二萬戶為直接興建、八萬戶是透過包租代管方式；截至今年五月，社宅興建進度為五萬一八五六戶，其中二○一六年前就有六五一五戶、新完工戶數九三七四戶，興建中及待開工為二萬二九七六戶，還有規劃中的一萬二九九一戶；若僅計算新完工戶數，占推動總戶數僅約十八％。\n業界分析，就算以五．一八萬戶社宅數來看，約僅佔最新發布去年第四季住宅存量比率的○．五八％，較其它先進國家仍有相當大的差距。\n另外，包租代管四年來僅媒合八千餘戶，達成率僅目標八萬戶的一成，未來四年得要趕進度逾七萬戶；業界推算，未來四年要兌現「八年二十萬戶社宅」目標，每年得直接興建逾一．七萬戶、包租代管要拚一年媒合近一．八萬戶。\n瑞普萊坊市場研究暨顧問部總監黃舒衛指出，社宅是以社會福利為出發點，但廣義社宅政策除了只租不售的住宅，還可擴及政府的租金補貼、購屋利息補貼等，加上後續租賃管理事務龐雜，實質供給量極低，就算比率最高的北市也僅○．八四％，不但遠低於歐洲國家動輒一至兩成，連美國約六．二％、新加坡約八．七％都還有很大差距。\n營建署長吳欣修解釋，社宅目前新完工數不到萬戶，主因是過去花太多時間在設計規劃，尤其是社宅要納入社福、托育，就耗時二到三年；目前已修改策略，確定社宅地點就直接發包顧問標，期間再拍板要公托或社福，六至九個月就可直接統包工程，興建期可縮短許多；未來的社宅樓層數不會高，假設基地超過○．六公頃，建物則興建地上六至八樓，高樓層也不會超過十五樓。\n他說，包租代管成效不如預期，是因過去宣導行銷方式不正確，未來將改變行銷方式，先行鎖定四十至五十歲的房東，這年齡層的房東對於政策最了解、也懂得住宅政策，「將一直努力朝八年二十萬戶社宅目標前進」。"

  chinese_body: "［記者黃明堂／台東報導］屏東小琉球海域14日驚傳有潛客一死一失蹤，其中，失蹤7天的巫姓潛水客的遺體，昨天下午4點多在綠島朝日溫泉海岸被發現，經過家屬今天指認，確認就是日前在小琉球失蹤的巫姓潛水客。\n海巡第一三岸巡隊綠島安檢所表示，昨天經海巡人員察覺發現該遺體身著之潛水衣，與日前小琉球潛水失蹤搜尋未獲之巫姓潛客相似，遺體昨天晚間近9點，由第十五海巡隊派遣巡防艇協助運送回台東富岡漁港，並轉送台東市立殯儀館暫置。今天經巫姓家屬至台東市立殯儀館指認，確認是小琉球失蹤潛客，後續將由台東地檢署辦理相驗事宜。\n海巡單位表示，綠島安檢所海巡人員到達現場後，初步檢視該遺體年約50至60歲、身高約170公分、左手配戴手錶、身著潛水衣及穿著防滑鞋，面部泡水許久浮腫嚴重，所以無法確認身分，但到場協處之海巡人員蘇小隊長想起日前屏東小琉球曾發生1員失蹤潛客迄今未尋獲案件，遂搜尋網路新聞資料比對，發現該遺體身著之潛水衣與失蹤潛客穿著之潛水衣顏色相似，所以聯繫高雄海巡單位琉球新安檢所將現場發現遺體之手錶及潛水衣等相關照片提供轉傳家屬協助指認。\n雖遺體面部浮腫難以辨識，但家屬從照片檢視之潛水衣、手錶等物品，今天再到台東市立殯儀館指認，確認是潛水失蹤的巫姓男子。"

  chinese_body: "美國會籲增太平洋部隊飛彈防禦\n〔記者涂鉅旻／台北報導〕中國解放軍持續強化軍力，美國國防部去年發布的「中國軍力評估報告」統計，中共陸射彈道、巡弋飛彈的總數，已達一三四○枚至二七四○枚，對台灣、美國等印太國家構成嚴峻威脅。為此，美國參議院軍事委員會近期通過「太平洋威懾倡議」，納入增加太平洋地區部隊飛彈防禦的內容，國軍今年也實施愛國者、天弓飛彈射擊訓練，驗證反飛彈能力，並持續研發及精進既有飛彈的性能與射程，全面強化反飛彈戰力。\n美國國防部二○一九年公布的「中國軍力評估報告」，揭露隸屬於中共火箭軍的陸射彈道飛彈、巡弋飛彈總數最大值達二七四○枚，較二○一八年公布的一九三○枚，大增八一○枚。\n軍方人士指出，美軍報告揭露的中共火箭軍飛彈，並非全數針對台灣部署，遠程、洲際飛彈等意在威懾美國，但我國未輕忽短程、中程飛彈及火箭彈的威脅，持續強化因應作為。\n我國軍實彈訓練驗證反飛彈能力\n有關強化反飛彈戰力，國軍持續進行反飛彈射擊訓練，今年將以天弓二型飛彈作為靶彈，驗證愛國者飛彈的攔截能力。\n另，我國自製「天弓三型」飛彈已實戰部署，國軍正進一步研製增程型飛彈，將射擊高度自四十五公里提升至七十公里左右，能在更高的空域攔截敵方飛彈。\n原供空軍ＩＤＦ經國號戰機使用的天劍二型防空飛彈，未來將供陸軍、海軍使用，陸軍已在今年起編列一四三億餘元採購「陸射劍二」飛彈用於野戰防空；海軍新型艦艇未來也可望使用「海劍二」飛彈，作為軍艦防空的主力軍備。"
