  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕每個國家的文化都不太一樣，大家到陌生國度生活的時候，總會鬧出一些好玩的趣事。近來，有女網友在網路分享，自己到一位美國朋友家作客時，對方使用自己最鍾愛的「台灣味紅盤」盛菜給她吃，她卻越吃越心虛，猶豫著該不該告訴朋友真相，逗趣的畫面頓時笑翻眾多網友。\n這名女網友在臉書社團「爆怨公社」發文表示，她去美國朋友家作客的時候，朋友熱情做了道菜給她吃，但是當菜餚到手上的時候，她才發現裝盛食物的器具竟然是「拜拜盤」，對方還很開心的表示這是他最喜歡的盤子，已經買了好幾個要送給家人，因為便宜又有台灣的特色，讓他驚呆表示，「我應該跟他說（真相）嗎⋯⋯」\n對此，網友紛紛笑回，「太可愛了啦」、「記得搭配這組時尚酒杯（敬神杯圖片）」、「怎麼沒有附蠟燭XDD」、「當你是神明哈哈哈」、「不要買金桶去燒垃圾就好XDD」、「還是說一下好了，不耐熱這點比較重要XDD」、「這應該放爆笑才對哈哈哈」，還有人分享自己的類似經驗，「我同事老公是英國人，覺得在台灣吃飯，還是要有燭光蠟燭，就去買了2個紅色蠟燭放在桌上，我同事說感覺自己要被超度了」。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者許麗娟／高雄報導〕民進黨高雄市長補選參選人陳其邁今天一早前往前鎮魚市場、興仁市場拜票，又到當地肉圓老店連吃了肉圓、魚丸湯和粄條湯，他說跑行程維持體力最好的方法就是「走到哪吃到哪」，並看著自己的肚子笑稱「腹院長」就是這樣來的。\n端午節一早，陳其邁清晨5點半就開始拜票行程，上午8點在高雄市漁會理事長謝龍隱的私房推薦下，到前鎮區和誠街上一家開業40多年的無招牌肉圓店吃早餐，陳其邁說，最喜歡的小吃首選就是肉圓，簡單又好消化，而且台北不容易吃到蒸肉圓，因為在港邊，在地魚丸又特別新鮮，吃完若能再加一碗紅豆牛奶冰最棒，高雄哪裡有好吃的紅豆牛奶冰他都知道。\n陳其邁的對手國民黨高雄市長補選參選人李眉蓁今天也是一早就跑十全路果菜市場，對此，陳其邁回應李眉蓁很年輕，有她自己的安排，而他的規劃是「摩頂放踵」的用兩隻腳跑遍高雄，預計38個行政區重要的市場、黃昏市場、魚市場等都會去握到每一雙手。\n陳其邁大啖肉圓的同時，店外也有許多支持著到場為他加油打氣和要簽名，讓一早的巷弄間變得非常熱鬧。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕全國公務人員協會榮譽理事長李來希日前批評小燈泡媽媽、時代力量立委王婉諭，遭外界砲轟，事後也被國民黨停權2年。沉寂多日後，李來希忍不住在端午節發文，痛批國民黨今年選舉失利，卻還在搞內鬥，直言「我們不投河，我們吃粽子去，總可以吧！」\n李來希今日在臉書發文回憶，他去年在大法官會議上，針對年改釋憲案激辯，但最終還是功敗垂成，於是他把希望寄託在今年國民黨的選舉上，「可恨的是國民黨高層師心自用，汲汲營營於私利，大好江山就這樣拱手讓人」。\n「可恨又復可悲，現在連好不容易取得的南方政權也丟了。」李來希直言，前高雄市長韓國瑜被罷免後，國民黨幾乎已經是一無所有了，但內部卻還在算計、還在扯自己人的後腿，「外戰無力，內鬥總是在行。」\n他最後感嘆，「今天也是端午節，我們不是屈原，我們不投河，我們吃粽子去，總可以吧！」"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕日本一名16歲的高中生日前因老師出作文作業，表示不限定用日文書寫，沒想到他竟腦洞大開，使用已經滅絕的語言「盧恩符文」（Runes）寫作文，原以為會考倒老師，沒想到「道高一尺，魔高一丈」，老師竟只花3.5小時就破解這篇天書，老師也幽默地在作業上寫道「給我加班費！」，這場「師生鬥法」被放到Twitter上，笑壞不少網友，大讚師生互動溫馨有趣，又佩服老師耐心驚人。\n綜合媒體報導，日本16歲高中生「kedamadama」因為看到老師出作文作業時，在卷末註明「可以用日文以外的文字書寫」，讓他突發奇想，將日文單字轉為羅馬拼音，再將英文字母轉換成現已失傳的歐洲中世紀語言「盧恩符文」完成這篇作文，他說原本以為這篇作文會被老師退回重寫，沒想到竟用紅筆在考卷上一一「破譯」，看到紙上滿滿紅字，讓他又驚又喜，直呼「我的班導好厲害」！\n而老師改完後也在作業下方寫下評語，表示「你寫得很不錯，但我花了3個半小時解讀，其實可以用普通文字來寫就好！」並在角落蓋了一個「你很努力」的印章，又幽默表示「這是給我自己的，你給我加班費！」，18日他將這份「破譯後的天書」分享到Twitter上，至今已有超過71萬人按讚、15萬次轉發。\n網友紛紛表示「老師好有耐心」、「這樣的老師不多了」、「羨慕有這種老師，給自己印章好可愛哈哈」、「這個學生很幸運，遇到一個好老師」。不過這名高中生不久後也另發貼文表示，這場「師生大戰」還有後續，目前他正嘗試使用知名動畫《神奇寶貝》的「未知圖騰」寫另一份作業，也讓網友們期待這次老師會給什麼評語。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者黃佳琳／高雄報導〕趙姓男子把愛車報廢交給林姓男子拆零件變賣，卻在半年後收到2萬8千元的交通違規罰單，趙男報警找真相，揪出原來是林男沒把車子報廢，而是賣給另名陳姓男子當代步車用，高雄地院依背信罪判林男拘役30日。\n判決指出，2018年7月初，趙姓男子把愛車、鑰匙及行車執照、保險證等證件交給林男，請林男幫他把愛車報廢；不過，趙的愛車因仍有貸款未繳清，無法辦理車牌註銷，於是雙方約定由林男先幫忙拆賣零件變現，再由趙把錢拿去還貸款。\n不過，林男拿到車子後，竟沒有把車子開去回收場，反而把車用2萬元賣給陳姓男子（不起訴處分）作為代步車使用，林再把2萬元中的8千元拿給趙男，謊稱是賣零件賺的錢，讓趙誤信愛車已拆解且不會在道路上行駛。\n陳男開著趙的愛車，卻不繳路邊停車費、高速公路通行費，半年多的時間加上交通罰單累計挨罰2萬8000元，由於車主仍是趙男，當趙男收到罰單後傻眼，不解為何愛車都報廢了怎麼還會收到罰單，經報警後才知道都是林男搞的鬼。\n高雄地院審理時，林男坦承犯行，但辯稱不知道這樣算犯法，他趕緊把賣車剩下的1萬2千元都還給趙男，希望換取原諒，法官考量到犯後態度良好，因此判他拘役30日，得易科罰金，可上訴。"

  chinese_body: "［記者黃美珠／竹縣報導］國內疫情雖然有變，但是端午連假第1天新竹縣各風景、遊樂區的人氣卻明顯回溫！\n國內指標性的六福村主題遊樂園今天一早開園後到下午2點左右，就有至少5000人入園，主要是因各地都塞車，導致遊客入園得晚，六福村行銷部經理黃淑芳說，預估今天一整天的來客量，將有過去假日單天的7、8成。\n他們也預估端午4天連假受好天氣等因素加持，有機會上看3萬人入園暢遊，跟去年端節3天連假的2萬2000人相比，絲毫不遜色。\n小叮噹科學主題樂園表示，他們今天的來客人數也不少，至少是去年端午連假首日的85%，預估1天下來應該會有1000人入園。\n至於4天連假實際會有多少遊客進場？他們不願當事前諸葛貿然判斷，但可以肯地的是，自從防疫政策解封以後，確實人氣已經回升很多。\n內灣商圈發展協會總幹事朱榮土說，今天很多人在家過端午節，所以該商圈的來客數量一天下來有比往常的節假日少一點，但也有3000人次的成績，人氣是一般節假日的75%。\n他說，疫情解封後，從民眾紛紛從「口罩」解放出來，走出戶外少見人帶口罩，可以看出大家想要「湧」出外的心情。所以預估4天可望會有3萬人次造訪內灣，大家都感受到人潮真的回來了。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕超商設置的「ibon」提供顧客購票、繳費、列印或寄包裹等多項服務相當方便，不過常常有民眾因為使用時間太長，引發占用機台的爭議。近來，有一名網友在臉書社團「爆廢公社」發文表示，自己看見一名阿伯搬椅子坐在機台前面使用，但是坐姿和操作手勢卻看起來相當眼熟，讓他又好氣又好笑的表示，「阿伯！你當作ibon是趴慶哥哦！？直接包台？」\n對此，網友紛紛笑回，「真的笑死，旁邊那單子好像在跑彩票」、「看他坐姿根本熟門熟路了」、「現在711也有斯洛打了你不知道嗎」、「凍結啦，一擊萬枚準備中」，不過也有人認為占用機台很沒公德心，其他人則猜測，「條碼那麼短，可能在列印東西，不像代收代售」、「3000元點卡買起來、刷一整排點卡」、「不會是在搶DS4悠遊卡吧」、「會不會列到最後一張，結果第一張繳費時間過了」。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者吳仁捷／新北報導〕新北市淡水一名國小3年級女童日前遭同校高一生刺3刀命危，住院近2週逐漸康復，總算趕在端午節前出院返家，女童回家後，飲食逐漸恢復正常，也吃了應景的粽子與甜粽，父親不捨的說，目前先努力讓妹妹淡忘恐懼，不去想恐怖的事，而弟弟在姊姊回來後，跟家人一起給她溫暖、支持，目前暫時不打算讓她回學校，等到身心狀況穩定，再考慮下一步該怎麼走。\n就讀新北市淡水區某中學16歲高一男學生，11日上學進校後不久，翻牆進入一旁小學校區，隨機選定正在排隊量體溫的10歲小學3年級女童，對她背部連刺3刀，一刀傷及肺臟，因氣血胸嚴重，送醫手術後送加護病房觀察；院方經近2週的救治，女童總算脫離險境，轉入加護病房後，端午節前出院返家。\n女童父親說，學校志工媽媽們送來多串肉粽、甜粽，希望讓妹妹好好過端午，他跟妻子都很感謝志工媽媽們的愛心，妹妹食慾逐漸恢復，幾天來跟弟弟一起吃了好幾顆粽子，爸媽們也希望透過端午佳節，讓妹妹忘記創傷，把創傷的陰影降到最低，讓生活、學習逐漸恢復正常。\n對於殘害女童的兇手，女童父親不願再談，但女童父親長輩氣憤的說，行兇的高中生家長仍還沒來道歉，好像從沒發生過這件事，家屬也不寄望任何不具誠意的道歉，由於7月即將開庭，目前都交給律師處理；但女童家屬對高一生仍未交代犯案動機、及家長刻意掩飾家境背景，讓被害家屬感受不到任何歉意、誠意，只能希望透過司法替愛女討回公道，更寄望政府多關切、用心婦幼安全。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者林良昇／台北報導〕國民黨改革委員會提出「新兩岸論述」，將九二共識當歷史描述，引起前總統馬英九等黨內大老疑慮，國民黨改革委員會青年組成員今到黨中央力挺新論述，強調不應虛耗去爭論九二共識存廢，年輕人想要看到的是國民黨有什麼價值，如果緊抱不去想新論述，可能讓國民黨失去一到兩個世代。\n國民黨改革委員會兩岸組提出「新兩岸論述」，將九二共識當成歷史描述，強調4大支柱，引起馬、吳、連等黨內大老疑慮，出現「九二共識存廢」論辯，國民黨改革委員會青年組成員今到黨中央召開記者會，力挺兩岸論述改革，主張國民黨需要論述的新空間，不應虛耗在爭論九二共識存廢。\n改委會青年組成員、台中市議員羅廷瑋強調，九二共識有無法抹滅的歷史，但國民黨不該糾結在過去，希望新的4大支柱可以符合社會期待，讓民眾能夠發覺國民黨的改變，改革比革命困難，「難免被改革的人會很不舒服」，有些需要過去歷史讓他們有存在感的人會覺得被抹滅過去的付出，但改革不是抹滅，而是近一步論述。\n羅廷瑋說，國民黨反對台獨不是因為共產黨反對台獨，年輕人也不只要國民黨反對台獨，而是希望聽到國民黨在努力哪些新價值及方向，才有支持國民黨的理由。\n青年組成員、全國青工總會長林杏兒指出，年輕人對於九二共識根本不熟悉，就好像傻瓜相機，長輩覺得很好，但年輕人已經拿手機拍照，年輕人沒有說傻瓜相機不好，但確實已經不合時宜，應重新包裝成年輕世代聽得懂的話語。\n青年組成員、台北市議員徐巧芯指出，有人會批評國民黨兩岸論述離民進黨越來越近，但事實上卻是民進黨離國民黨越來越近，從台灣獨立到台灣共識到維持現狀，現在講中華民國台灣，國民黨堅持中華民國，連民進黨都要靠過來，國民黨不該把焦點放在辯論要不要九二共識，而是把目光放回對民進黨的監督。\n青年組成員、台大政治研究所學生須予謙坦言，在校園裡面，九二共識沒有任何人接受，任何政黨都要注意永續，年輕人重視價值，對於新兩岸論述的四大支柱，年輕人族群樂觀其成，如果國民黨要緊抱九二共識，不去想新論述，可能會讓國民黨失去一到兩個世代。\n青年組成員、副召集人黃士修表示，兩岸組的論述並沒有要捨棄九二共識，恐怕有溝通上的誤會，不希望這樣的誤會掩蓋改革委員會的主張跟實行。他也認為，國民黨不應害怕思考「李登輝路線」務實華獨的可能性。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者鍾麗華／台北報導〕每年暑假是中國對台統戰旺季，不但拉攏台灣青年學生到中國實習、參訪，還有各式夏令營、研習營、體驗營等，今年受到武漢肺炎（新型冠狀病毒病，COVID-19）疫情影響，暑假統戰旺季不旺，中國國台辦旗下「中國台灣網」的「青年公社」網頁停擺，至今還在推播去年的活動與職缺。\n中國對台統戰對象，無論是過去的「三中一青（中小企業、中南部、中低收入、青年人）」或現在的「一代一線（年輕一代，基層一線）」，目標都是要鎖定台灣青年與學生，透過統戰交流活動，培養對中國的好感，讓台青畢業後能到中國就業、創業，甚至落戶。\n中國國台辦從2016年開始，透過「青年公社」每年舉辦「台灣青年暑期實習計畫」，並提供住宿及不少於2000元人民幣（約台幣8300元）的補貼。而在暑假前，國台辦會在例行記者會誇稱召募情況，並在暑假後，吹噓台生前往實習的狀況，2017年就曾稱，「有4000多名台灣青年學生暑期在大陸各地事業單位實習」。\n去年為配合中國領導人習近平的「一國兩制台灣方案」，北京推出讓台灣學生赴粵港澳大灣區實習計畫，藉以宣傳「一國兩制」，台灣多所國立大學還張貼由台辦系統主辦的相關實習計畫，遭到教育部、陸委會關切後，各校才下架招生宣傳。\n而「青年公社」的網頁至今首頁推播仍有「隴台青年大學生舞蹈藝術創作研習營」、「兩岸青年城市體驗營」、「我選湖北、千崗迎台青」等，不過，都是去年的活動與職缺，而「陝西十三所高校發佈招收台灣學生簡章」則是今年的消息。至於「青年公社」臉書沒有暑假實習與營隊活動消息，倒是張貼許多自製的「兩岸青年說」影片，批評台灣政府。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者羅欣貞／屏東報導〕屏東縣竹田鄉的竹田車站是台鐵屏東線上僅存的木造車站，竹田鄉公所經整修打造成「竹田驛鐵道故事館」，今天正式開館，民眾可利用端午連假前來朝聖。\n\n竹田驛園曾有「最美日式車站」美譽，去年通車滿100年，並在10月被登錄為屏東縣歷史建築；最初竹田只是簡易停靠站，1939年客貨運增加，才擴建為現今所見的木造站房，1992年運量減少，車站一度面臨拆除命運，經地方極力爭取保留下來，1998年鐵路局與竹田鄉公所簽約，由公所認養車站站房。\n\n竹田鄉文化觀光所所長曾國峰指出，原來委外經營的竹田驛站，在今年合約到期後，交由鄉公所文化觀光所接手，老舊站房在初步修繕後，打造成「竹田驛鐵道故事館」，站長室經保留整理，陳列竹田老車站的文史資料、老照片，未來還會開放遊客穿上古早的站長服拍照，並持續爭取文化部經費，展開後續整修計畫。\n\n今天開館第1天就有不少民眾前往參觀，看到古早的剪票口、貨運磅秤、故事館內的模型、竹田驛園介紹等，都感到很新鮮，竹田鄉長傅民雄表示，除了日式傳統「四柱造」的站體，遊客還可以到一旁、有亞細亞最南端日文圖書館之稱的「池上一郎博士文庫」，以及舊倉庫改建的「李秀雲先生攝影紀念館」，來一趟深度的文化之旅。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者彭琬馨／台北報導〕民眾黨徵召親民黨籍高雄市議員吳益政投入高雄市長補選，除身為連任5屆的高雄市議員外，吳益政與即將出任駐美代表的蕭美琴還有另一番趣聞。在蕭美琴「一個人也可以」自傳中曾提到，她就讀美國哥大期間，曾為了力抗中國留學生粗魯蠻橫打壓而舉辦台灣慶典的活動，當時同在哥大就讀的吳益政也是活動熱心志工之一，在大家同心協力的努力下，讓台灣攤位成為當年參加哥大國際慶典攤位中業績最好的第一名。\n蕭美琴在自傳中提到，哥大每年舉辦的「國際屋」慶典中，都會由各國留學生擺設攤位、展示各國的文化禮俗，當年她原本不打算辦活動，卻有中國留學生在會議中表示「台灣是中國一部分，沒有自己的文化，不准出現以台灣為名的攤位！」一番完全不符事實的發言惹惱蕭美琴，她認為「不想辦是一回事，被人脅迫不能辦是另一回」，因此決定爭取主辦「台灣攤位」的權利，在哥大其他同學的支持下也順利開辦。\n蕭美琴向紐約台灣同鄉會與台美人銀行募款、在傳單上刊登廣告，同時有多位叫會家長協助準備炒米粉、貢丸湯、冬瓜茶等道地的台灣小吃。因受到中國留學生的打壓，台灣同學與同鄉反而很自然的團結起來，不分黨派、沒有色彩，更無族群之別。\n蕭美琴也特別提到，高雄的親民黨籍市議員吳益政也是當時熱心幫忙的同學之一，眾志成城下，台灣攤位生意興隆，不僅是全場最熱的場子，也是業績最好的攤位。\n蕭美琴在自傳中說，中國對台灣的打壓無所不在，就連許多民間、學生間的交流，都會受到兩岸間的政治角力影響；蕭美琴說，原先對政治毫不關心、無所謂好惡的的學生，經此打壓後「會對中國有好感嗎？」反而可能因此更強化他們「走台灣自己的路」的意念。\n吳益政曾就讀於哥倫比亞大學國際政治經濟碩士，自2002年起擔任高雄市議員至今，日前宣布代表民眾黨出馬參選高雄市長補選。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者蘇金鳳／台中報導〕對於中市府要開罰中火，身為台中人的立法院副院長蔡其昌表示，發電量足不足夠應回歸專業，而不是整天政治操作，政治人物的秀場，人民已經看膩了！\n蔡其昌表示，昨天尖峰用電3716萬瓩是台灣用電史上第3度衝破紀錄，過去從未在6月出現這麼高用電量。代表著夏季尖峰用電已來臨，夏天發電機組狂操，為確保萬一遇上突發事故，仍有足夠電力可調度，避免發生限電或停電的狀況。所以，台電先讓歲修完成的2號機組啟用，也讓運轉已久的1號機組關掉檢修。\n蔡其昌強調，發的電夠不夠用？需不需要啟用發電機組？應該回歸用電專業，而不是變成政治人物的秀場，人民已經看膩了。\n蔡其昌指出，前年台中市長盧秀燕用「市長換人空氣換新」的口號，得到了市長大位，今年初甚至如法泡製打出「總統換人空氣換新」，結果冬季時，火力發電廠關了一半機組，空污卻還是紫爆連連。\n他說，現在因為用電量突破歷史新高，必須啟用發電機，盧秀燕與國民黨又開始大動作指控空污，結果啟用後，今天空氣品質十分優良，又被重重賞了一巴掌。\n蔡其昌強調，用電與空污問題，需要中央地方攜手合作，除了一起推動中火燃煤機組的更新成「燃氣機組」的進度，台中市各項固定污染源與移動污染源都需要全面進行檢討改善，還有來自中國的境外污染問題，否則只是一再拿中火政治操作，不要再把人民當傻子。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕國際記者聯盟（IFJ）23日發布名為「中國故事：重塑世界的媒體（The China Story: Reshaping the World\'s Media）」的調查報告，發現中國長期透過各種方式「買通」非英語系國家的記者，來推動中方的跨國政策、增加中國的影響力，且IFJ警告中國正通過收購外國媒體、大型電信企業來控制各國民眾接收新聞、資訊的管道，而這些行為都有逐年增長的趨勢。\n根據《衛報》報導，IFJ從去年9月開始進行調查，詢問58個國家的新聞公會，是否曾收過來自中國的「好處」，包括贊助旅行、內容共享協議以及與中方機構合作。結果發現有29國記者曾前往中國，近三分之二受訪者認為，中國在自己國家的媒體具有明顯影響力；中方單位也曾向三分之一的新聞機構提供合作機會。\n調查發現，中國政府越來越依賴國外的記者來提升自己在該國的形象，特別是「開發中國家」的媒體工作者，在IFJ調查期間，9名緬甸記者至少收到2次中國的「出訪邀請」，其中1名還去過9次。此外，中國政府也曾帶著穆斯林國家的多組記者團到新疆的「再教育營」，希望「洗白」侵害維吾爾族人權的指控，影響國際輿論。\n此外，中國政府也優先向參與「一帶一路」項目國家的記者示好，自從菲律賓的總統通訊辦公室與中國官媒簽署合作備忘錄後，多名菲國記者開始在中國受訓，有一名菲國記者透露，他觀察到該國其他記者撰寫報導時，往往會融入《新華社》或其他中國官媒的觀點。\n雖然報告指出，中國不是唯一想影響國外記者的國家，包括美國、以色列等國同樣致力宣揚自身立場，但報告作者林（Louisa Lim）認為中國使用的手段更加廣泛，且能鎖定個別國家，而且最大的不同在於，中國會主動邀請這些記者「參訪」，甚至在離開前要求各國記者簽署協議，警告不要寫批判中國的報導，過程中，翻譯人員和官員也在旁監視。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕韓國京畿道安山市一處幼稚園，近日發生大規模食物中毒，目前已累計99名學童感染，部分患者出現溶血性尿毒綜合症的症狀。\n據《韓聯社》報導，首批病例於16日在幼稚園內出現，當時有4名學童腹痛不已，到了17日又多了10名小孩開始腹瀉，至今總共有99人食物中毒，其中22人到現在還在住院。\n衛生當局經過檢驗後，發現是腸道出血性大腸桿菌所造成的食物中毒，通常是進食生牛肉或受污染的食物才會感染這種大腸桿菌，病徵為劇烈的痙攣性腹痛、嘔吐和輕度發燒，其併發症之一就是溶血性尿毒綜合症（HUS）。\n1982年，美國有數十名兒童在吃漢堡時由於肉餅沒有煮熟，最後感染了HUS，是以此病又被稱為「漢堡病」，一些患者的腎臟功能可能會受損，需要進行腎臟治療。\n雖然目前安山市的幼稚園已經關閉，但2名學童的家裡出現了家庭感染，也同樣有HUS患者，因此相關單位認為腸道出血性大腸桿菌已被傳播出去。\n另外，幼稚園1名老師的樣本驗出了病原體，但他並未出現任何病徵，可以說相關症狀僅在小孩當中出現。南韓衛生當局已針對此案展開流行病學調查，不過迄今尚未查出肇禍的食物。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕佛洛伊德之死引發的平權示威運動持續在美國延燒，許多中、上階層人士紛紛透過行動表達支持。美國女演員克莉絲汀貝爾和珍妮史雷不約而同發出聲明，未來不再替動畫片中的混血或黑人角色配音，認為這個工作應該留給黑人族群擔綱。\n史雷是情劇喜劇動畫《青春無禁忌》中黑人女孩Missy的配音員，她在週三發表聲明，指自己當初接下這個角色，是因為女孩的母親是猶太裔白人，就和她的母親一樣，但Missy也同時是一名黑人，現在的她認為，應該要讓黑人來扮演這個角色才是正確的選擇，「我意識到我當初的思考方式有所缺陷，這正是種族優勢及不公正存在在『白人至上』社會體系的證明。」\n克莉絲汀貝爾是迪士尼知名動畫《冰雪奇緣》安娜的配音員，近來則在歌舞動畫片《中央公園》替黑人女孩Molly配音，她在社群媒體發布一封製作單位的公開聲明，寫道克莉絲汀自第一天起就參與了《中央公園》的製作，那時都還沒有提供角色給她。如今的她與製作團隊意識到，Molly讓黑人或混血演員來扮演的話，才能夠呈現出製作單位賦予這一角色的細微差異和經驗，因此將尋找別的演員接替這個工作，但強調克莉絲汀會持續在劇中扮演新的角色。\n克莉斯汀自己則寫道，「是時候承認我們是共犯結構的一部分，我的行為就是一個例子，扮演Molly顯示出我對這種無處不在的特權缺乏意識，讓白人演員扮演這個角色削弱了美國混血或黑人的獨特性。」"

  chinese_body: "〔記者蔡宗憲／屏東報導〕屏東警分局盧姓警員因與經營色情應召站業者不當交往，涉足應召站落跑時摔裂腿骨，昨天被縣警局記大過一次，拔除教官職務調恆春分局，但這個決定引爆恆春輿論沸騰，縣議員盧玟欣氣炸痛批屏縣警局「把縣長故鄉當回收場嗎？」\n這樣「調恆春」的作法在早期屏東警界是常態，但在前縣警局長方仰寧要求「自己問題自己解決」要求下，一度改變了這項警界陋習，但據了解，從前年開始，「出狀況」的員警又開始被「懲罰性調度」到恆春，目前至少有四、五名類似狀況員警在恆春分局。\n「被親友詢問到恆春服務是不是發生什麼事？實在情何以堪！」一名恆春資深警員表示，他喜愛恆春的好山好水才到此服務，現在卻因為高層莫名其妙的作法，感覺受到異樣的眼光，明明恆春警力已經不足，還當做懲罰調度地區，員警繁重勤務恐怕雪上加霜。\n屏縣議員盧玟欣接獲不少當地民眾抱怨，指出，恆春半島是五星縣長潘孟安及小英總統故鄉，如今卻變成員警出狀況調動的「化外之地」，還大剌剌在所有傳播媒體上發佈，把恆春分局當資源回收場的作法太可惡，當地居民不能接受被出狀況三流員警服務，也幫努力認真服務的原恆春分局員警們抱不平。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者羅添斌／台北報導〕美軍繼昨天一口氣出動5架軍機在巴士海峽反潛偵巡之後，今天上午又派出3架軍機，分別到巴士海峽丶南海偵巡，根據軍情航空相關網站推特發佈的取新訊息顯示，其中1架P-8A海神式偵察機，經過巴士海峽後，更是直接往東沙島方向飛去，再往中國東南沿海進行抵近偵察。\n中國北京大學海洋研究院「南海戰略態勢感知計劃」平台（SCSPI）今天發佈訊息指出，美軍今天上午有3架軍機，分別到巴士海峽丶南海執行任務，包括：P-8A海神察機及RC-135偵察機各1架，另外有1架C-17A大型軍用運輸機，也經由巴士海峽飛往南海。\n根據SCSPI推特訊息顯示，其中1架P-8A海神式偵察機，是在台灣南部的巴士海峽至東沙島之間的空域，進行來回的反潛偵偵巡行動。\n我軍方官員今天指出，美軍軍機密集的在巴士海峽至東沙島之間偵巡，並且以聯合反潛任務模式執行任務，必然是有對共軍潛艦動向情資的掌握，但以出勤次數之密集丶出動機型之多，研判美軍也是藉此情勢，測試美軍在南海聯合行動的穩定及可靠性。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕香港反送中運動自去年6月展開後，一直傳有示威者循秘密管道來台的消息，由於港版國安法即將施行，中共當局可直接抓捕「覺得有必要」的嫌犯，扣留在特設的拘留中心，不受扣留時間限制，再度傳出反送中人士欲偷渡來台，偷渡費水漲船高，喊到100萬港元（約新台幣381萬），而香港偷渡來台的路線也曝光。\n親中港媒《大公報》報導，反送中運動一年來，已有200多名示威者逃往台灣，由於許多人護照遭到當局扣留，循水路偷渡來台成為他們的首選，香港西貢、香港仔、筲箕灣等3碼頭成為逃亡熱點，乘船到達公海再由駁船載往台灣。\n有當地經營漁船30多年的船長透露，很多船家都不約而同收到電話詢問前往公海的收費多少，還有人探詢，最快途徑去台灣要多少錢，他開價25萬港元（約新台幣95.3萬），必須直接付現，對方竟回問「最快可以何時開船」，後來聽到其他船家表示，公道價至少要30萬港元（約新台幣114.3萬），「如果是名人，起碼要1人50萬」。\n漁船載著偽裝成釣客的示威者，由香港水域航至轉往台灣接駁船的公海約36小時，快艇則需18小時，記者喬裝成偷渡客詢問，有船主提供2條路，1條坐漁船出公海，再在公海坐另1艘接駁船，再上台灣漁船，載往高雄、台南、台中等，另1條由水路在廣州上岸，包車到廈門，然後乘漁船往金門。\n這名船主表示，執法人員對漁船檢查較鬆散，反而坐遊艇入境，8成都被攔查，但最近港版國安法在即，被警方截查風險提高，稱有客人嘗試偷渡3次都未果。\n針對香港反送中示威者偷渡來台傳聞，移民署與海巡署在去年12月曾回應尚未接獲相關情資，不過未來將持續嚴密監控，杜絕任何不法形式的偷渡者。"

  chinese_body: "［記者鄭淑婷／桃園報導］李姓男子於2018年間透過友人介紹，在桃園市桃園區租屋，用來作為挖比特幣的「礦場」，另從屋外接線竊取台電電力，豈料，因日夜不停挖礦導致用電過量引發火警，李男竊電行為才曝了光，台電依據他每日用電量，向他求償一年電費共610餘萬元，但桃園地院法官認為應以李男租期開始為起算點，最後判決李男須賠償台電274餘萬元；李男竊電行為另有刑事責任，已被依竊盜罪判處5月徒刑。\n李男為了挖彼特幣，於2018年5月31日透過陳姓、謝姓友人介紹，向張姓屋主承租位於桃園區的房子，租期從2018年6月15日到2021年6月14日，李男租屋後就利用工具，從屋外拉了3條導線進屋，竊取台電電力作為電腦、排風扇等設備的電源，卻因用電量過大於2018年11月22日引發電線走火，因此被警方及台電公司桃園營業處稽查員查獲，李男隨即被依竊盜罪移送法辦，台電也依據李男每日用電量，向李男及張姓屋主求償一年電費共610餘萬元。\n李男經合法通知都未到庭，也未提出書狀聲明或陳述，而張姓屋主則稱，他只是租屋給李男，不知李男有竊電行為，無端被一併請求鉅額賠償，顯然沒有任何依據。\n判決指出，台電求償應以李男租期為起始點至發生火災日，另考量他日夜不停挖礦、24小時都在用電，依據李男屋內的用電設備來計算，李男須賠償台電274餘萬元；而張姓屋主部分，並無證據顯示他有與李男共同竊電，台電主張他須負連帶責任，顯屬無據。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者陳慰慈／台北報導〕捲入藝人徐乃麟北市內湖豪宅「米蘭苑」詐賭糾紛的董子綺，官司不斷，今年1月二審依賭博罪判她徒刑5月確定，不料，又被知名徵信業者江梅綺指控，詐騙開公司的登記規費11萬餘元，此外，她11年前另涉嫌侵占公司合夥人的51萬餘元公款，台北地院日前依詐欺、業務侵占等罪判處她有期徒刑1年，得易科罰金36萬元，可上訴。\n判決指出，有「徵信天后」封號的江梅綺，2018年2月與董子綺合作，開設販賣酵素的公司，江女請託董女辦理公司登記，董女以要向國稅局、衛生福利部等單位繳交規費及需業務行銷費，向江女索討11萬餘元，事後卻避不見面，江女始知受騙提告。\n此外，董女於2009年間任職一家法律事務所，負責處理一家汽油批發公司的設立登記、帳務、報稅等事宜，卻利用職務上保管該公司銀行帳行存摺及印章之便，私吞該公司的50萬元驗資款及公款1萬5500元占為己有。\n審理時，董女對犯行坦承不諱，法官考量她與汽油批發公司調解成立並先賠償25萬元；跟江女也達成和解，已賠償10萬元，並承諾按月給付2萬元以償還餘款約定，因此業務侵占罪判她徒刑6月、詐欺罪徒刑5月，合併執行徒刑1年，得易科罰金。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者彭琬馨／台北報導〕立法院副院長蔡其昌今早接受蔻蔻早餐專訪時說，廢考監向來都是民進黨的主張，但提名監委與廢考監是兩回事，選監委是為了要有人行使監察權，若此時沒有選監委，在大法官過去釋憲文中就是違憲；蔡其昌並說，很高興看到國民黨呼應廢考監的主張，他建議國民黨團可先連署提出廢考監修憲案，並由黨主席江啟臣公開對外宣示，以展現國民黨對廢考監的決心。\n立法院國民黨團總召林為洲23日朝野協商時拋出，國民黨也贊成廢考監兩院，因此此次應暫緩監委提名，盡速組成修憲委員會以進行廢考監，朝野討論修憲廢考監兩院的聲浪再起。\n立法院副院長蔡其昌今接受蔻蔻早餐專訪時強調，當今若直接廢除考監，恐引發監察權無人行使的問題，在過去大法官釋憲中已表示過，這種做法是違憲的，民進黨向來主張廢除考監兩院，但在修憲完成監察權移轉前，提名監委與廢考監是兩回事。\n主持人周玉蔻追問，此次監察院副院長黃健庭提名風波，對民進黨造成的傷害。蔡其昌表示，他認為總統府的出發點是好意，為了讓藍綠關係和諧一點，因此原先希望能從別的政黨找到適當人選，但「方法不好」。\n此外，針對高雄市長補選，蔡其昌也說，辭官參選的陳其邁展現出來的狀態「跟上次完全不一樣」；蔡其昌說，他認為陳其邁只要穩紮穩打，把過去這一年在行政院的表現展現出來就可以了，不用太多花言巧語。\n蔡其昌也說，他認為國民黨應該還是會在這次選舉中獲得第二名，若是選輸民眾黨「他們就可以打包回家了」。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕中國雲南省交通運輸廳中午通報，今日凌晨在西雙版納傣族自治州境內瀾滄江與南班河交匯處有一艘載有27人的船隻不幸翻船沉沒，表示目前已搜救到9人、18人失蹤，仍在展開搜救工作。\n綜合中媒報導，今日凌晨在雲南西雙版納瀾滄江附近水域發生沉船事故，一艘載有27人的船隻在瀾滄江與南班河交匯處翻沉。而該省的交通運輸廳在中午1時左右才正式向媒體透露此一消息，表示目前已搜救到9人，仍在展開搜救工作。\n官方並強調事故發生後，省委書記陳豪、省長阮成發當即要求全力搜救，救治傷患。副省長王顯剛率省級有關部門，立即趕赴事故現場指揮救援工作；副省長、省公安廳廳長任軍號第一時間到省公安廳指揮中心「視訊」指揮調度救援。省委常委、常務副省長宗國英，省委常委、省委政法委書記張太原則要求調查事故原因。\n大部分中國網友祈求船上人都能平安獲救，也有人悲觀表示時間過這麼久、南方連爆紅水，可能凶多吉少。仍有網友忍不住酸，「9人？是活人嗎？」、「這稿的官名、人名怎麼比整件事的描述還長呢」，但有些留言已被刪，且部分新聞已關留言功能。"

  chinese_body: "首次上稿11:58更新時間14:36\n〔記者許倬勛／桃園報導〕去年7月發生震驚社會的鐵路警察遭刺死案，驚悚一幕歷歷在目，今天是端午連假首日，台鐵又傳出有乘客在車廂揚言「要殺全車旅客」，搭乘大眾運輸工具安危再度引起討論。\n有網友於上午7點在PTT發文，表示自己乘坐，清晨5點58分從基隆七堵站開往屏東潮州站的103車次自強號列車，近7點行經桃園站時，與他同坐在第3節車廂的男子，不斷喃喃自語，忽然起身大喊：「我要殺全車旅客！」讓他嚇得魂飛魄散，不知要往哪逃。\n鐵路警察局於7點接獲匿名報案，由台北分局中壢派出所派員前往中壢站處理，將疑似發狂大吼的39歲古姓男子請下車，並確認其身分。\n中壢所所長呂俊雄表示，古男於6點38分在板橋站上車，搭乘南下列車要返回苗栗通霄老家，有乘客轉述「他看起來有些焦躁」，但經詢問列車長、乘客，均無人表示有暴走言行，查無實證下，安撫古男情緒穩定後，由員警陪同返家休息。\n警方聯繫古男母親，古母表示兒子患有躁鬱症、領有重大傷病卡，這幾天因未按時服用藥物，加上天氣燥熱與熙來攘往的人潮，讓他備感壓力導致病情復發，才會在座位上喃喃自語，行徑看來較奇異，但過去從未有傷害他人的舉動。\n此外，由於車廂內未設有監視器，警方只能調閱沿線月台監視器，均未發現有乘客恐慌或逃離車廂等畫面，對於乘客、網友可能「烏龍爆料」有散布謠言之嫌、造成民眾心生畏懼恐慌，可依《社會秩序維護法》裁罰，已聯繫上在PTT「爆掛」的網友，將通知到案說明，以釐清案情經過。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕巴基斯坦航空部長沙瓦爾（Ghulam Sarwar）24日在國會發布上月97死空難的初步調查報告時，驚爆該國有40％飛行員持有假飛行執照。\n綜合外媒報導，巴基斯坦國際航空（PIA）一架空中巴士A320客機上月22日墜毀，造成97人喪生，初步調查報告顯示，這起空難原因是飛行員和航空管制員的人為疏失。沙瓦爾24日在國會發布空難報告時，透露有關「假」飛行員的驚人消息。\n巴基斯坦有860名現役飛行員，其中包括巴基斯坦國際航空、Serene Air和藍色航空（Air Blue）的飛行員。從2019年2月開始的調查顯示，其中有262名飛行員沒有親自參加考試，而是要求其他人代考。\n沙瓦爾說，他們在調查過程中發現，持有「假執照」的飛行員甚至沒有適當的飛行經驗。40％持有假執照的人，還包括數百名不是現役飛行員。\n巴基斯坦國際航空發言人今（25）日表示，該公司426名飛行員中，有將近150人因持有「可疑」的證照而被下令停飛。\n沙瓦爾昨日在國會說，很不幸的是，飛行員竟牽涉政治任命，「在任命飛行員時，功績竟被忽略了」。他還說，巴基斯坦國際航空至少4名飛行員的學位被發現是假的。\n他說，當局已就這方面問題進行調查，並已向54名飛行員發出「陳述理由通知」，「有一些飛行員在法庭上對通知提出質疑，到目前為止，至少9人坦承學位造假。」"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕中國長江流域近期暴雨連連，三峽大壩潰壩危機議題成為關注焦點，中國總理李克強上週再度簽署三峽保衛令，凸顯大壩水利工程隱患。對此，外媒統整專家說法，分析當局對三峽大壩工程的報告用語與歷史真相。\n《美國之音》指出，現居德國的中國國土規劃專家王維洛針對大壩變形相關新聞點出一項關鍵重點，即是變形量有無精確描述，王維洛直言，長江設計院總工程師王小毛在描述壩基位移時僅以「水平位移變化很小」一句話草草帶過，而非直接定量描述變化量有多少公分，其中必定大有問題。\n王維洛進一步解釋，王小毛在描述壩頂位移時清楚地報告「水平位移達3公分」，但在描述壩基位移時卻只說「變化很小」，這在定量報告中是不正確也不合理的，其中肯定有隱情。\n中國著名水利工程學專家黃萬里早在34年前就曾針對在三峽施作大壩工程一舉做出負面預測，他認為，移入長江的礫卵石河床料及水中懸沙將不斷沉積，最終堵塞重慶港並阻斷航道，更嚴重的是，此現象將在洪水爆發期間台高水位，淹沒低窪地區，後果可能比1983年陝西安康漢水氾濫造成的慘絕人寰災情更嚴重10倍。\n黃萬里之女，「黃萬里研究基金」負責人黃肖路表示，父親反對長江大壩工程理由有4大點，其中末項「三峽水庫對長江中下游防洪效果不彰」正是當前面臨的處境，她說，過去常說大壩可防萬年一遇的洪水，後來變為千年一遇，再來轉為百年一遇，如今遭遇這次的洪水時，「其防洪能力已經成了未知數」。\n黃肖路指出，在父親眼中，長江大壩就是個禍國殃民的工程，完全是利益集團貪腐的過程，她說，父親曾發表反對大壩興建以及南水北調方案的文章，文章一出，許多科學院地理所的科學家都警告他，稱該文內容非常好，但已得罪一大票利益集團。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕美國近期陷入種族對立困境，美國太空總署（NASA）今日宣布，將以NASA史上首名非裔女工程師瑪麗·傑克森（Mary Jackson）重新命名該機構位於華盛頓特區的總部大樓，而她正是電影《關鍵少數》女主角之一的原型人物。\nNASA署長布萊登斯汀（Jim Bridenstine）今日發表聲明指出，傑克森的傑出貢獻幫助美國贏得太空競賽，不過更令人嘆服的是她「不願屈服於現狀」的特質，布萊登斯汀表示，傑克森勇於打破障礙，更在種族隔離風氣盛行的當下協助開啟其他非裔女性的機會之窗。\n傑克森1921年出生於美國維吉尼亞州，並在2005年與世長辭，作為NASA史上首名非裔女性工程師，她的故事在2016年被寫入紀實書籍《關鍵少數》（Hidden Figures），傑克森的角色在電影中是由美國非裔女歌手、女演員賈奈爾·夢內（Janelle Monae）所飾演。\n1940至1960年代，NASA「水星計畫」讓美國首度將人類送進外太空，也連帶影響後續的登月行動，其中瑪麗．傑克森、凱薩琳．強生（Katherine Johnson）與朵蘿西．豐恩（Dorothy Vaughan）等3人可謂該計畫幕後功臣，功不可沒。\n儘管這3人成就非凡，卻因膚色及性別使其受到嚴重歧視，她們的故事也連帶遭埋沒，直到2016年電影上映後才為世人所知。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕1950年6月25日韓戰爆發，造成數百萬人死亡，即便1953年簽署停戰協定，但技術上來說，以美國為首的聯軍仍在與北韓作戰，因為南北韓並未簽署和平協議。雙方近日情勢緊張，在戰爭爆發70週年之際，南韓僅在非軍事區附近低調舉行紀念活動，演員穿上當時韓戰服裝，釋放和平鴿。\n據《路透》報導，即便目前南北韓情勢緊張，南韓仍在非軍事區附近舉行韓戰紀念活動，與會者包含曾參與韓戰的退伍軍人。1950年爆發的韓戰於1953年在簽署停戰協訂後暫歇，但是以技術上來說，以美國為首的聯軍仍在與北韓作戰，因為當時並未簽署和平協議，如今70年過去了，和平協議的希望忽明忽滅，現在看起來又回到遙遙無期的狀態。\n《路透》指出，針對韓戰，北韓官報以整頁篇幅強調民眾要追隨過往烈士的腳步，持續捍衛國家安全，報導內容提及，「數十年過去了，但戰爭的危險從未離開這片土地」，並指責「敵對勢力」持續壓迫北韓。2年前，美國總統川普與北韓領導金正恩的會面，中國與南韓的會面，一度出現了實質終結戰爭的希望。\n不過，隨著北韓批評南韓及美國堅持敵對政策後，這些會談帶來的希望全部破滅，北韓對抗態勢與日俱增，除了進行短程飛彈試射外，更一舉炸毀兩韓聯絡辦公室，切斷雙方熱線，即便24日北韓決定暫緩對南韓軍事行動，但仍警告南韓要「放聰明點」。\n歷史學者估計，韓戰造成逾百萬軍人及數百萬平民死亡，使數千個家庭遭非軍事區分隔，和平活動組織「女性穿越非軍事區」（Women Cross DMZ）共同創辦人安（Christine Ahn）表示，「從家庭分崩離析到生活在極端軍事化的朝鮮半島，未解決的韓戰狀態摧毀了韓國人」。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者陳鈺馥／台北報導〕國民黨革命實踐研究院長羅智強近日在「未來沙龍」臉書直播節目直言，在「情理法」三個層次，國民黨於法站得住腳，在黨國體制下就是有優先權利可「合法取得」黨產，只是民眾情理上不能了解。對此，黨產會發言人孫斌受訪表示，國民黨看來仍不懂黨產條例，憑藉黨國一體專政從國家取得的財產，怎會是合法取得。\n據悉，國民黨主席江啟臣上週在中常會拋出「黨產歸零」後，在網路頻遭泛藍支持者痛罵是對民進黨投降，被質疑宣示黨產歸零，不就等於自認黨產是不義之財。\n行管會主委邱大展在節目解釋，黨產歸零不是黨主席江啟臣上任才提出，包含前總統馬英九、朱立倫黨主席任內、全國黨代表大會都有決議，要讓「黨產歸零」捐做公益。黨產歸零一直沒做到，不是國民黨不想歸零，而是民進黨不讓你歸零。\n羅智強更直言表明，選舉是一句話的戰爭，以後國民黨就可以大聲地說，「我要捐，是民進黨不讓我捐！」\n對此，黨產會表示，國民黨的目的是什麼，從節目談話就清楚可見，不必多加評論。願意相信國民黨是有誠意願協商黨產，不是進行選舉操作。\n黨產會強調，國民黨自認黨國體制「合法取得」的黨產，在法律上站得住腳，顯見國民黨仍看不懂黨產條例規定。黨產條例立法就是為了處理當年黨國一體威權體制，在形式上看似合法，實際非法取得的財產。\n孫斌指出，國民黨自知黨產乃透過黨國不分取得，過去國民黨一黨專政，要怎麼拿形式上都會合法，但實際就是靠特權不法，亦即悖離民主憲政秩序，這是台灣民主化後待處理的轉型正義議題。\n「不會沿用過去協商內容！」孫斌提及，黨產會第一次與國民黨協商時，中投、欣裕台股權尚未認定不當黨產，「促進轉型正義條例」也未立法，現在時空環境不同，黨產會已下處分須移轉國有，雙方若有協商，不會拿過去行政協議直接沿用。\n孫斌指出，不當黨產不是想捐給誰就捐給誰，促轉條例明定須納入特種基金，做轉型正義、社會福利等用途，預算經費、用途須經立法院監督，不是像國民黨所講的外行話，可直接被民進黨拿去用，而是公開透明接受國會監督。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者洪美秀／新竹報導〕新竹市政府推動首起公有地自辦都更竹蓮市場案，從2014年初推動，與佔用戶與借用戶溝通多年後，要求佔用戶6月底完成搬遷自拆，預計7月召開招商說明會。這處佔地1400坪的土地，將朝集合式住宅方向規劃，市府辦理招商後，可望讓有意願的實施者針對此區塊進行開發，繼而帶動竹蓮市場周邊商機與環境再造。\n市府都發處說，位在竹蓮市場後方的市有地，佔地約1400坪，幾乎是百分百的市有地，但過去長期被佔用或借用，時間超過50年，部分被佔用土地已被蓋屋或蓋鐵皮屋臨時設攤，更有轉租給他人，被佔用戶約11戶。此外，屬借用的住戶約6戶，過去曾借給法院及建華國中做為退休員工宿舍，但年代久遠，原借用戶早已搬遷，如今淪為租用或設臨時攤販，因攤販未納管，環境髒亂，易成治安死角。\n都發處說，這塊市有地早在前市長許明財任內即啟動公辦都更，是竹市首起公有地公辦都更案，需與佔用戶與借用戶溝通，耗時頗久，期間市府財政處認為佔用戶私佔市有地，已向佔用戶提出需收取這些年來佔用土地的使用補償金，同時要求佔用戶需在今年6月底前自行搬遷或拆除，否則市府將進場拆除。\n都發處說，目前已有8戶佔用戶自行拆除還地，剩下的住戶仍在做最後溝通，至於此處前幾天發生的鐵皮屋火警，屬借用戶土地，經火調人員研判是電線走火導致，與市府啟動都更案無關。\n都發處強調，竹蓮市場後方的市有地長期被佔用、借用，已成為地方治安死角，加上環境髒亂及臨時攤販私設，都影響此區塊的整體發展，市府7月將召開公開招商說明會，期許讓這塊竹市首起市有地公辦都更案能順利招商，透過實施者進行整體規劃與開發，除了讓土地活化，連結竹蓮市場周邊環境與公園綠地，提升這個區塊的整體環境與市容。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者劉禹慶／澎湖報導〕真的是螺絲鬆了？端午節連續假期伊始，澎湖機動查緝隊查獲合順盛號漁船，涉嫌走私大量中國香菇，帶回海巡隊馬公隊準備偵訊，卻遲遲等不到衛生局人員到場會合，近8個小時後才姍姍來遲。\n\n澎湖機動查緝隊調查指出，日前接獲線報，有漁船趁端午節民生物資需求量大，走私大量中國農特產品，今日凌晨在澎湖目斗嶼西北方18浬海域，查獲合順盛號漁船私運中國香菇一批，1時30分被押返海巡隊馬公隊部，但因通知衛生局人員，卻遲遲無人到場，因防疫規定，相關人員只能在現場枯等，直至上午通知縣長秘書，衛生局人員才於9時出現。\n\n由於武漢肺炎（新型冠狀病毒病，COVID-19）爆發以來，中國是病毒發源地，沿海省分都是嚴重疫區，澎湖縣長賴峰偉多次呼籲及要求澎湖漁船不能在海上和中國漁船接觸，或者進行海上交易，以免帶來病毒。賴峰偉強硬表示，如果有漁船帶進病毒，將可能把漁船所在的村里及港口，封村或封港。\n\n針對外界質疑，澎湖縣政府衛生局表示，疫調工作是第二線，應等到相關調查報告出爐後，才由衛生局進行疫調，與第一線執法人員認知有出入，未來將協調各單位，建立相關流程處理SOP；根據執法人員表示，這次衛生局人員還姍姍來遲，上次查獲不明寵物走私，都看不到衛生局人員。根據最後清點結果，走私香菇118袋，每袋約17公斤，總數約2000公斤。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者楊心慧／台北報導〕台北市警察局將住宅竊盜案列為重要偵辦目標，近5年來住宅竊盜案更逐年下降，從2015年的656件，逐年減少到2019年的440件，台北市議員王浩卻發現，雖住宅竊盜案減少，但大安分局、士林分局、南港分局，3個分局的住宅竊案數卻是不減反增，尤其是大安分局最為嚴重，竊賊卻仍挑市長附近的住戶下手，他要求少數肅竊成效不佳的分局提出改善作為，避免更多民眾受害。\n王浩指出，大安分局住宅竊案增加最為嚴重，過去5年住宅竊案增加20件，再來是士林分局的15件、南港分局的6件，2015至2019年，台北市共有21個派出所的住宅竊案增加，其中有12個派出所是這3個分局所管轄，若以派出所細分，可發現增加最多的前3大派出所分別為是和平東路所7件、新生南路所7件、後港所6件。\n王浩表示，住竊案增加最多的和平東路所，是柯文哲住家的轄區派出所，雖然附近有警力加強巡邏，但竊賊卻仍挑市長附近的住戶下手，視警方如無物。\n王浩質疑，是否警察局在警力配置出現問題，過度偏重於政要人士的維安工作，忽視平常的治安工作，他要求警察局應就現行警力分配不均的現象做通盤檢討，並提出具體改善作為。\n台北市警察局表示，有關首長、政要官邸安全及各轄區治安維護，警察局都很重視，市長維安勤務，於離開寓所及返回寓所時，除派遣必要警力維護，並無再有其他特別派遣，並沒有排擠維護治安警力的狀況，但警察局也將針對上開勤務派遣及防制作為隨時進行滾動式檢討，以因應各項治安維護。"

  chinese_body: "〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕日本沖繩縣石垣市議會在22日通過提案，將釣魚台名字從「登野城」變更為「登野城尖閣」，引發台灣各界譁然，甚至影響到民間交流，蘇澳鎮與石垣市締盟姊妹市今年屆滿25週年，原計畫在9、10月舉行姊妹市25週年活動喊卡。\n據日本《琉球新報》報導，今年適逢蘇澳鎮與石垣市締盟姊妹市25周年，蘇澳原計畫在9、10月舉行姊妹市25週年活動，但恐因釣魚台改名爭議而取消，蘇澳鎮長李明哲受訪時表示，本計畫25周年活動將邀請石垣市長中山義隆來訪，但漁民們對於釣魚台改名十分不滿，這個時機不宜舉辦活動。\n李明哲強調，對於釣魚台稱呼，台日之間都有自己的看法，但他不希望政治因素影響兩地關係，他強調未來仍會與石垣市密切交流；今年4月石垣市爆發武漢肺炎疫情，因屬離島，防疫嚴重物資不足，蘇澳各界募集防疫物資空運到石垣市，解當地燃眉之急，中山義隆也透過視訊會議，代表石垣市民向蘇澳表達無限感謝。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者陳慰慈／台北報導〕民眾提供詐欺集團銀行帳戶，供車手提領詐欺款是否構成洗錢罪？最高檢察署認為，2017年6月洗錢防制法修正後，最高法院並未對洗錢罪構成要件正式發表意見，導致一、二審法院判決不一，有害司法形象，因此日前向最高法院提案聲請書給刑事大法庭，盼能統一法律見解。\n提案緣起於台北市一名唐姓民眾，前年1月將郵局與銀行的存摺、提款卡及密碼給詐騙集團，待被害民眾匯款入唐姓民眾帳戶後，車手旋即將款項提領一空。\n一審認為，掩飾或藏匿詐欺集團犯罪所得去向的行為當然屬於洗錢行為，依洗錢罪判唐姓民眾徒刑4月，併科罰金5萬元；二審則認為，唐姓民眾提供帳戶時，詐欺集團並未開始實行詐騙，因此主觀上無掩飾或隱匿不法所得的故意，不構成洗錢行為，僅成立幫助詐欺罪，改判處有期徒刑3月，得易科罰金9萬元，緩刑2年。\n最高檢聲請書認為，販賣人頭帳戶者，雖多屬經濟弱勢者，但他們為了數千元蠅頭小利不惜犧牲他人，導致被害人痛失後半輩子所賴以生存的退休金，其惡性非輕，以洗錢罪論處應非過苛。\n但此案一、二審已出現肯定說、否定說的不同見解，有些案件甚至二審看法也有歧異，因類似案件眾多，連同此案至還有9案在最高法院審理中，最高檢認為有必要徵詢各承辦庭意見，因此提案給大法庭，以減少各庭判決岐異；若未能獲准，也建請進行言詞辯論，以獲得此重要法律爭議的適切解答。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者鍾麗華／台北報導〕中國今年3月1日開始施行「網絡信息內容生態治理規定」， 對中國網路言論空間自由產生巨大衝擊。成功大學政治系教授洪敬富表示，這是中國領導人習近平新一波限縮公民社會、言論自由，強化社會監控的具體表現，朝向中國數位威權主義發展。規範內容易引人入罪、要求內容供應者「姓黨」。繼「以黨領政」後，「以黨領網」正在習核心治下快速成形中。\n洪敬富在最新一期的陸委會「大陸與兩岸情勢簡報」撰文表示，「網絡信息內容生態治理規定」（下稱「規定」），是直接以國家的力量介入網路空間與個人在網路上的自由，顯示中共對網路可能帶來的民主化、自由化與提供民眾串連的途徑等現象感到忌憚。\n洪敬富說，其法律內容集中共近年來對網路的管理與控制規定之大成，各項條文細節可說是徹底將本已受諸多限制的網路空間更具體集中為中共「一黨」，甚至習近平「一人」為核心的「黨國傳聲筒」，於是在此規定下，異議的言論自由，特別是網路創作與自由言論可謂一言堂般的政治正確。\n洪敬富指出，「規定」直接介入網路供應者的供應機制、形式和內容，並課責這些網路內容供應者積極呈現、「推播」該法所鼓勵的內容，要他們要「姓黨」，成為中共數位威權政體的代理人與不可分割的宣傳紐帶。除將侵蝕已經微弱的多元聲音與網路自由特性外，國家機器更具體、直接且全面地介入網路虛擬社群中，繼「以黨領政」外，復加習核心「以黨領網」的重要時代表徵。\n洪敬富解釋，「規定」除鼓勵網路使用者生產或轉發符合中共意識形態、統治合法性、基本立場和方便性的內容，另一方面，也禁止網路使用者生產或轉發各類有違中共基本意識形態與路線或危害社會安全與輿論等的內容。\n洪敬富分析，「規定」除要求網路供應者接受國家與社會的監督，也要求這些供應者設立「便捷的投訴舉報入口」、「公佈投訴舉報方式」、「及時受理處置公眾投訴舉報並反饋處理結果」，加上該法的各項鼓勵與禁止事項界定寬泛且恣意，致使中國的網路世界正向一個互相監督、彼此猜疑的「全景式監獄」（panopticon）快速成形中。"

  chinese_body: "〔中央社〕中國全國人大常委會日前通過了「中華人民共和國人民武裝警察法」修訂。與過去的版本相比，不僅內容增加，並納入海警部隊；且已不見中國國務院，改由中共黨中央及中央軍委集中統一領導。\n中國第13屆全國人民代表大會常務委員會在20日舉行第19次會議，通過「中華人民共和國人民武裝警察法」（武警法）修訂版。這是「武警法」繼2009年公布後，時隔11年再修訂。比較兩者，舊版共有7章、38條，共約3300字；新版則增至8章、51條，共有5300多字。\n舊版「武警法」提到，武警部隊是由中國國務院、中共中央軍事委員會領導，實行統一領導與分級指揮相結合的體制；新版則已不見中國國務院，改為由中共黨中央、中共中央軍委集中統一領導。\n與舊版不同的是，新版「武警法」第1章「總則」第3條提到，武警部隊堅持中國共產黨的絕對領導，貫徹中共總書記習近平的強軍思想，貫徹新時代軍事戰略方針，按照多能一體、維穩維權的戰略要求，加強練兵備戰等。\n另外，第1章「總則」第4條也提到，武警部隊擔負執勤、處置突發社會安全事件、防範和處置恐怖活動、海上維權執法、搶險救援和防衛作戰以及中共中央軍事委員會賦予的其他任務。\n第2章「組織和指揮」第9條則將海警正式以法律形式納入武警部隊，指出武警部隊由內衛部隊、機動部隊、海警部隊和院校、研究機構等組成。內衛部隊按照行政區劃編設，機動部隊按照任務編設，海警部隊在沿海地區按照行政區劃和任務區域編設。具體編設由中共中央軍事委員會確定。\n第8章「附則」第47條則提到，武警部隊執行海上維權執法任務，「由法律另行規定」；第48條則表示，武警部隊執行防衛作戰任務，依照中共中央軍事委員會的命令執行。新版「武警法」已在6月21日施行。\n港媒明報引述「日本經濟新聞」指出，中共在2018年進行「黨和國家機構改革」後，海警便從中國國家海洋局劃歸武警，而武警也改由中共中央軍委領導，但這是「首次以法律形式作出規定」。\n香港01引述消息人士說法分析，新版「武警法」通過後，中國方面若判斷釣魚台列嶼一帶處於戰時狀態，中國法律允許在東部戰區指揮下，武警將和海警艦艇共同作戰。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者吳正庭／金門報導〕針對媒體報導金防部翁姓上兵涉嫌酒駕，卻因其姐曾任職金防部人事行政處，僅被處以2次申誡，引起同袍私議，金防部今天回應，翁員拒絕酒測，但無法證明有酒駕，至於翁是否受其姐「庇蔭」才被輕罰？金防部表示，絕無可能。\n媒體報導指出，陸軍金門防衛指揮部翁姓士兵去年8月遭警方攔撿，疑因身上有酒味，被要求進行酒測，翁員當場拒絕，當時適逢酒駕新制7月上路，相關罰款提高，翁因拒絕酒測遭罰款18萬元、吊銷駕照3年。\n對於翁員行為，翁服役的連級單位以拒絕酒測未及時回報、違反軍紀為由，施以申誡2次處分。有同僚質疑，翁僅受申誡處分是否和其曾在金防部人行處工作的士官姐姐有關。\n對此，金防部政戰部主任劉強華說，翁員拒絕酒測是事實，但因沒有酒測，無法證明翁員酒後開車，不能算是酒駕。翁員的懲處是由其工作的連級單位決定，與事發前1個多月已調離人行處的士官姐姐無關，「一個士官怎麼可能去影響懲處」？金防部絕無護短徇私。\n劉強華表示，「依法行政」、「酒駕零容忍」是金防部一貫立場，將繼續宣導軍法紀教育，使官兵知法守法，確實維護軍譽。\n根據國防部「國軍軍風紀維護實施規定」明令嚴禁酒後駕車，其中第24條指出，無論吐氣所含酒精濃度或血液中酒精濃度多寡，凡因酒後駕駛交通工具而肇事者，可依陸海空軍刑法追究刑責，並做出相關懲處；「酒精濃度」及是否有肇事行為？是軍方懲處的關鍵。\n金門縣警察局交通隊表示，警方執行一般路檢，對於可疑的酒駕者均依照「取締酒後駕車作業程序」，從和駕駛人的對話中觀察其是否有酒味？再研判是否進一步做酒測的決定，對於金防部的管理表示尊重。"

  chinese_body: "〔記者劉力仁／台北報導〕108年總統大選期間，台大新聞所教授王泰俐撰寫文章評論網紅與假訊息相關事宜，遭「童溫層」之節目製作人兼主持人童文薰，以自訴方式控告王泰俐妨害名譽，台北地方法院日前判決王泰俐無罪。\n根據判決書內容，童文薰認為王泰俐於108年11月29日撰寫「政治微（偽？）網紅與假訊息的距離」一文，在思想坦克發表，誣指「童溫層」節目大量複製「政經關不了」的內容，並以「低成本產製雷同的內容」云云，既未查證「童溫層」節目製作的成本，更未查證「童溫層」節目資料來源以及發表時間，是否被其他節目抄襲，倒果為因，因此告王泰俐加重誹謗。\n根據判決書內容，童文薰指民國108年9月4日，總統蔡英文對2位追查論文與學位真相之學者提起訴訟，於是「童溫層」節目開始追查論文真假之謎。所有資料均係獨立調查所得，絕無抄襲更無大量複製其他節目內容。\n法官則認為，「童溫層」頻道於108年5月開播，9月後開始追查蔡英文論文真假之謎，王泰俐的文章研究之頻道時間範圍，亦限定於108年8月29日至同年10月29日，「童溫層」頻道於108年9月、10月分別發表26集、19集之影片，王的文章寫作脈絡係先提出「政經關不了」於108年5月開播以來即以蔡英文論文案為該頻道討論主題，而文章所提出之10個頻道包含「童溫層」頻道，亦討論相同主題，並非憑空杜撰、無中生有而虛捏事實。\n法官在判決書中載明，王泰俐文章主要針對於YOUTUBE影音平台上發表與蔡英文論文案為主題之頻道而發，攸關閱聽者對於訊息來源掌握是否正確，理由文章具事實基礎，且發表之言論出於善意並具公益性，屬社會可公評之事，也未超過合理評論的範圍，理應受憲法言論自由之保障。法官在判決書中載明，童文薰有自己的影音頻道，就公共事務的辯論，處於較為有利的地位，因此面對評論，應較一般人有更大的容忍程度，並受到公眾檢驗。\n王泰俐表示，她長期從事影像新聞、政治傳播的研究，因107年縣市長選舉期間，發現台灣假訊息的狀況愈來愈嚴重，所以投入相關研究，撰寫一般民眾都可以看得懂的評論文章。希望網路上傳播的訊息，都能夠謹慎判斷真假，她在文章中，列舉出去年2019年8月底到10月底之間，10個集中在攻擊蔡英文總統偽造學歷的YOUTUBE頻道，她的評論泛指這幾個頻道，沒有特定針對任何一個頻道。"
