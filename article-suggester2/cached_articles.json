  chinese_body: "話分兩頭，這會兒我們得回到海狸夫婦和另外三個孩子身上來了。海狸先生剛說完「一刻也不能耽擱」，大伙兒都開始匆匆忙忙穿上大衣，只有海狸太太開始拿起一些口袋放在桌上，說：「好了，海狸先生，把那塊火腿拿下來。這是一包茶葉，還有糖，一些火柴。誰到角落的瓦罐里拿兩三個麵包出來。」\n「你在幹什麼呀，海狸太太？」蘇珊叫道。\n「給我們每個人收拾一份東西，小寶貝，」海狸太太十分冷靜地說，「你們不想上路時沒東西吃吧？」\n「可我們沒時間了！」蘇珊說著扣上大衣領上的扣子，「她隨時都可能到這兒的。」\n「我就是這麼說的。」海狸先生插嘴說。\n「你們別胡說，」它妻子說，「好好想想，海狸先生。她至少要在一刻鐘以後才能到……\n「如果我們要趕在她前頭先到石桌那兒，」彼得說，「我們不是要儘可能搶先一步嗎？」\n「你得記住一點，海狸太太，」蘇珊說，「她到這兒一看，發現我們走了，就會飛速離開的。」\n「她會的，」海狸太大說，「不過我們無論如何也趕不到她前面，因為她乘著雪橇，我們是走著去的。」\n「那麼——我們就沒希望了？」蘇珊說。\n「好了，你們乖，別大驚小怪，」海狸太太說，「請從那個抽屜里拿出六條幹凈手絹吧。我們當然還有一線希望。我們趕不到她前面，不過我們可以隱蔽起來，走一條她意想不到的路，也許能成功。」\n「對極了，海狸太太，」它丈夫說，「不過該是我們動身的時候了。」\n「你也別大驚小怪的，海狸先生，」它妻子說，「瞧，這樣就好些了。這兒有四份東西，最小的一份就給我們當中最小的一個：那就是你，寶貝兒。」她看著露茜加了一句。\n「哦，求你快點吧。」露茜說。\n「好吧，現在我差不多都準備好了。」海狸太大終於回答說，一面讓丈夫幫它穿上雪地靴，「我想，縫紉機太重，帶不了吧？」\n「是啊，太重了，」海狸先生說，「重得不得了。我看我們趕路你總不見得能用上縫紉機吧？」\n「想到妖婆亂動我的縫紉機我就受不了，」海狸太太說．「她八成會把縫紉機弄壞或偷走。」\n「哦，請快點吧！請快點吧！」三個孩子說。就這樣他們才終於出了門，海狸先生鎖上門。(「這會耽誤她一點時間。」它說。)他們就此出發了，大家都把自己的一份行李扛在肩上。\n他們上路時雪已經停了，月亮也出來了。他們排成單行走著——海狸先生走在頭裡，隨後是露茜，再后是彼得、蘇珊，海狸太太走在末尾。海狸先生帶他們穿過堤壩，走到河的右岸，然後走到河岸下面樹叢里一條崎嶇不平的小路上。月光照耀下，山谷兩邊的峭坡高聳入雲。\n「最好儘可能在下面走，」海狸先生說，「她只能從上面走，因為不能把雪橇趕到下面來。」\n如果是坐在安逸的扶手椅里，往窗外眺望，看到的也許算得上是一幅美景；儘管事情到了這個地步，露茜開頭對這兒還是很欣賞的。不過隨著他們走啊走的，她背上的口袋也越來越重了，她開始懷疑自己怎麼堅持得下去。河面以及水帘子都結了冰，她不再去看那條亮得耀眼的冰河，也不去看樹頂上大團大團的雪，以及那光芒四射的大月亮和數不清的星星，只看著前面海狸先生那短小的腿在雪地里啪噠啪噠地走，彷彿永遠也停不下來似的。接著月亮不見了，雪又開始下了。最後露茜累得幾乎是邊走邊睡了。突然，她發現海狸先生離開河岸往右走，領著他們奮力爬上陡峭的山坡，走進密集的灌木叢中。等到她完全清醒過來，她發現海狸先生鑽進山坡上的一個小洞里，那個洞幾乎完全被灌木叢遮住，一直走到洞口才看得見。事實上等她明白是怎麼回事，已經只看得見它那扁扁的短尾巴了。\n露茜趕緊彎下腰跟著它爬了進去。接著她聽到身後急急忙忙爬行的聲音和喘氣聲，不一會兒，他們五個都進了洞。\n「這到底是哪兒呀？」彼得說，黑暗中他的聲音聽上去又疲倦又乏力。(我希望你們知道我說的聲音乏力是什麼意思。)\n「這是海狸遇難時一個老的藏身處，」海狸先生說，「是一大秘密。地方雖不怎麼樣，不過我們一定得睡上幾小時。」\n「要不是你們動身時都那麼手忙腳亂，我本來可以帶幾個枕頭來的。」海狸太太說。\n這兒跟圖姆納斯先生的石窟可相差太遠了，露茜想著——只是一個洞，不過洞里還算乾燥，而且是泥土地。洞非常小，因此當他們全都躺下時，就成了一大堆皮毛和衣服。這樣躺著，再加上他們長途跋涉身上也暖和了，他們果真覺得相當舒服。要是這洞里的地稍微平整一點就更好了。隨後海狸太太在黑暗中傳過來一個小小的長頸瓶子，每個人都就著瓶子喝了一口——喝了這東西叫人直嗆．嗓子眼火辣辣的，不過咽下肚去以後倒使人感到暖和得舒心——大家立刻就睡著了。\n露茜覺得似乎只過了片刻(雖然實際上已是好幾小時以後了)，她一覺醒來感到身子有點冷，而且僵硬得可怕，心想能洗個熱水澡該有多好。隨後她就覺得有一束長鬍子撩在臉蛋上怪痒痒的，又看到洞口有冰涼的陽光照進來。這一來她當然立刻完全清醒了，而且大家也都醒了。事實上他們全都坐了起來，眼睛嘴巴都張得大大的，傾聽著他們昨晚走路時一直想著的聲音(有時他們還想象著聽到了呢)。那就是鈴鐺的聲音。\n海狸先生一聽見聲音頓時就鑽出洞去。也許你會像露茜當時所想的那樣，覺得它這麼做是犯傻了。其實這麼做倒是很聰明的。它知道自己能躲在山坡頂上的灌木叢中不讓人看見；最主要的是它想看看妖婆的雪橇往哪條路走。其他幾個都坐在山洞裡等著，滿腹疑慮。他們大概等了五分鐘。接著聽見了什麼動靜，嚇得他們要命。他們聽見了說話聲；\n「哦，」露茜想，「它被發現了。她逮住它了！」\n出乎意外的是，過了一會兒，他們竟聽見海狸先生的聲音在洞口叫他們了。\n「沒事兒，」它大聲叫道，「出來吧，海狸太太。出來吧，亞當和夏娃的兒女們。沒事兒，原來它不是她！」這句話當然有點不通，不過海狸激動起來就是那麼說話的；我是說在納尼亞——在我們的世界裏海狸通常是根本不說話的。\n於是海狸太太和孩子們就匆匆忙忙走出洞來，大家在陽光下直眨眼睛，身上全是土，看上去髒兮兮的，又沒梳洗過，個個都睡眼惺松。\n「來吧！」海狸先生叫道，它高興得幾乎要跳舞了，「來看哪，這對妖婆是個沉重的打擊！看來她的權力已經完蛋了。」\n「你到底什麼意思，海狸先生？」他們大家一齊爬上了陡峭的山坡時，彼得喘著氣問。\n「我不是告訴過你們嗎？」海狸先生回答說，「她把這兒變得一年到頭都是冬天，而且從來不過聖誕節。我不是告訴過你們嗎？好吧，你們來看哪！」\n於是他們全都站在山坡頂上，放眼望去。\n只見一輛雪橇，有幾隻馴鹿，挽具上掛著鈴鐺。不過這些馴鹿比妖婆的馴鹿大多了，它們也不是白鹿，而是棕色的鹿。雪橇上坐著一個人，大家一見這人就認識了。他個頭高大，身穿一件鮮紅的袍子(像冬青果那麼紅)，戴一頂裡面有皮毛的風帽，一部白色的大鬍子像滿是泡沫的水帘子垂在胸前。人人都認識他，儘管只是在納尼亞才見到他這種人．但甚至在我們的世界里——就是在衣櫃門這一邊的世界里——我們也見過他們的畫像，聽人談起過他們。不過一旦你在納尼亞真正看到他們，這就不大一樣了。在我們的世界里，有些聖誕老人的畫片把他畫得只是外貌有趣、逗人而已。不過現在孩子們真正站在他面前瞧著他，就覺得並不完全是這樣。他是那麼魁梧，那麼高興，那麼真實，他們全都靜了下來。他們感到非常高興，但也非常嚴肅。\n「我終於來了，」他說，「她把我趕走多年了，但我終於進來了。阿斯蘭在行動，妖婆的魔法在減弱。」\n露茜只覺得渾身上下快活得顫抖起來，這種感覺只有在你心情莊嚴而寧靜時才會有。\n「好了，」聖誕老人說，「給你們禮物吧。海狸太太，給你一台更好的新縫紉機，我路過你們家時會把縫紉機送去的。」\n「請別見怪，先生，」海狸太太說著行了個屈膝禮，「房子鎖上了。」\n「鎖和門閂對我沒什麼關係。」聖誕老人說，「至於你嘛、海狸先生，等你回到家，就會看到你的堤壩完工了，修好了，所有裂縫都不漏了，還配上了一道新的水閘門。」\n海狸先生高興得嘴巴張得老大，什麼話也說不出來。\n「彼得，亞當的兒子。」聖誕老人說。\n「在，先生。」彼得說。\n「這些是你的禮物，」聖誕老人說，「是工具，而不是玩具。用上這些東西的時候也許就快到了，好好帶著吧。」說著他遞給彼得一把劍和一面盾。盾是銀色的，當中有一隻撲騰的紅獅，就像剛摘下的熟草莓那麼紅。劍柄是金鑄的，還配有劍鞘和佩劍用的腰帶，以及一切用劍必備的東西，而且劍的尺寸和重量對彼得也正合適。彼得接過這些禮物時默默無言，態度嚴肅，因為他覺得這是一份十分莊嚴的禮物。\n「蘇珊，夏娃的女兒，」聖誕老人說，「這些是給你的。」他遞給她一張弓、一隻裝滿箭的箭袋和一隻小小的象牙號角。\n「你必須在緊急時才能使用這弓箭，」他說，「因為我無意讓你去打仗。這弓箭百發百中。一旦你拿起這隻號角，吹響了，不管你在哪兒，我想你都會得到幫助。」\n最後他才說，「露茜，夏娃的女兒。」露茜走上前去。他給她一隻小瓶子，看上去好像是玻璃的(不過事後人們說那瓶子是鑽石做的)和一把小匕首。「在這個瓶子里，」他說，「有一種妙藥，是用長在太陽之山上的一種火花的汁提煉的。如果你或是你哪個朋友受了傷，灑上幾滴就能治好。這把匕首是給你在緊急時自衛的。因為你也用不著打仗。」\n「怎麼，先生，」露茜說，「我想——我不知道——不過我想，我會夠勇敢的。」\n「不是那個意思，」他說，「讓女人打仗是醜陋的。現在呢，」——說到這兒他突然看上去不那麼嚴肅了——「還有一些東西是眼下給你們大家的！」他拿出(我猜是從他背上那隻大口袋裡拿出來的，不過沒人看見他怎麼拿的)一隻大托盤，上面有五套杯碟，一缽方糖，一罐奶油，一隻嘶嘶直響的滾燙大茶壺。接著他叫道：「聖誕快樂！真命國王萬歲！」說著一揚鞭子，他們還沒看清他已經動身了，他就駕著馴鹿拉的雪橇走得沒影了。\n彼得剛從劍鞘里抽出劍給海狸先生看，海狸太太就說：「好了，好了，別站在那兒說話，說得茶涼了。像個男人的樣子。來幫幫忙把托盤搬下去，我們就要吃早餐了。幸虧我想到把麵包刀帶來了。」\n於是他們走下陡峭的山坡，回到洞里，海狸先生切了點麵包和火腿，做成夾肉麵包，海狸太太斟茶，大家吃得津津有味。不過沒等他們好好享用多久，海狸先生就說，「現在是行動的時候了。」"

  chinese_body: "晚上好！」露茜說。但是羊怪因為只顧拾地上的紙包，沒有來得及回答露茜的問候。等他把東西全部拾起來以後，他才向露茜微微的鞠了一個躬。\n「晚上好，晚上好。」羊怪說，「實在對不起，請問，你大概就是夏娃①的女兒吧？」\n「我的名字叫露茜。」露茜回答說，她不全懂他的話。\n「請問，你是個女孩嗎？」\n「當然嘍，我是個女孩。」露茜說。\n「你真的是人嗎？」\n「我當然是人。」露茜說，她仍然有點摸不著頭腦。\n「肯定是的了，肯定是的了，」羊怪說，「我多傻啊！我從沒看見過亞當的兒子和夏娃的女兒是什麼樣子。我很高興，這就是說……」說到這裡他忽然停住不說了，話已到了嘴邊，好像又猛地想起不該這麼說似的。「很高興，很高興，」停了一會兒他繼續說道，「請允許我做自我介紹，我的名字叫圖姆納斯。」\n「見到你我也很高興，圖姆納斯先生！」露茜說。\n「啊，露茜，夏娃的女兒，」圖姆納斯先生說，「請問，你是怎樣到那尼亞來的？」\n「那尼亞？那是什麼地方？」露茜問道。\n「這兒就是那尼亞的國土，」羊怪說，「它全部的國土是在燈柱和東海邊上的凱爾·巴拉維爾大城堡之間。你呢，你是從西邊的野樹林那裡來的嗎？」\n「我，我是從一間空屋的衣櫥里進來的。」露茜說。\n「唉！」圖姆納斯先生以一種有點憂鬱的聲音說道，「假如我小時候多學點地理，對這些奇怪的國家的情況就會一清二楚了，現在後悔莫及啊。」\n「它們根本不是什麼國家，」露茜說，她幾乎要笑出聲來，「就在我後面不遠的地方，真的呀，那兒還是夏天。」\n「可是，」圖姆納斯先生說，「在那尼亞，現在卻是冬天。這裡的冬天是這樣漫長。嗯，我們這樣站在冰天雪地里談話會著涼呢。啊，夏娃的女兒，你來自遙遠的空屋之國，那裡，永恆的夏天統治著光明的衣櫥之城。你願意到我家裡和我一起吃點茶點嗎？」\n「不了，圖姆納斯先生，」露茜說，「我該回去了，謝謝你。」\n「只要轉個彎就到了，」羊怪說，「我家裡生著很旺的爐火，有烤麵包，沙丁魚，還有雞蛋糕。」\n「啊，你真好，」露茜說，「但我只能稍坐一會兒。」\n「請你抓住我的手臂，夏娃的女兒，」圖姆納斯先生說，「這樣，我們就可以合撐一把傘了。好，請跟我走吧。」\n露茜就這樣，和這個奇怪的人手挽著手穿過了樹林，好像他們老早就是好朋友似的。\n沒過多久，他們來到了一個地方，這裡的路面高低不平，到處都是石頭，起伏的小山連綿成片。在一個小山谷的谷底，圖姆納斯先生突然拐向一旁，向著一塊大石頭徑直走去，最後，露茜發現他正領著她來到一個洞口。他們一走進洞內，露茜就感到兩眼被木柴火照得睜不開來。圖姆納斯先生蹲下去，用一把小巧的火鉗，從火堆里夾出一塊正在燃燒的木柴頭，點亮了一盞燈。「馬上就好啦！」他一邊說，一邊把一個水壺放在火上。\n露茜想，她從來沒有到過比著更舒適的地方。窯洞不大，四壁的石頭泛著紅光，洞內很乾凈，地上鋪著一條地毯，擺著兩張小椅子（「一張我坐，另一張給朋友坐。」圖姆納斯先生說），還有一張桌子，一個碗櫥，火爐上有個壁台，壁台的上方掛著一幅白鬍子老羊怪的畫像。窯洞的一角有一扇門，露茜想，這一定是通向圖姆納斯先生的卧室的。門邊的壁櫥上面放滿了書，書名有：《森林之神的生活和學習》、《山林水澤中的仙女》、《人、僧侶和獵場看守人》、《民間傳說的研究》、《人類神秘嗎？》等等，羊怪擺出餐具的時候，露茜就翻看著這些書。\n「好了，夏娃的女兒，就請吃吧。」羊怪說。\n說實在話。這是一頓很豐盛的茶點，先是每人一隻深黃色的煮雞蛋，煮得很嫩，接著是沙丁魚蓋烤麵包，然後又是奶油麵包，蜂蜜拌烤麵包，白糖蛋糕，應有盡有。等露茜一點兒也不想再吃的時候，羊怪就和她攀談起來。他有許多有關林中生活的精彩的故事。他向她描述了夜半舞會的盛況，講水仙和樹仙怎樣出來和農牧之神一起跳舞，講長長的打獵隊伍怎樣追逐乳白色的仙鹿，這種仙鹿如果你捕捉到了，它就會給你帶來希望。他還講了森林裡的宴會，講了怎樣和機靈的紅髮矮神在離地面很深的礦井和岩洞里尋寶。最後，他講了林中的夏天。那時，樹木都披上了綠裝，年邁的森林之神常常騎著肥壯的驢子來拜訪他們。有時，酒神巴克斯也親自光臨。巴克斯一來，河裡流著的水都變成了酒，整座森林一連好幾個星期都沉浸在節日的歡宴中。「哪裡像現在這樣，冬天總是沒完沒了啊！」他話頭一轉，顯得很是憂傷。為了振奮精神，他從碗櫥上面的箱子里拿出一根小笛子吹了起來，這笛子看起來很奇怪，好像是用稻草稈做的。那曲調使露茜一會兒想哭，一會兒想笑，一會兒想跳舞，一會兒又想睡覺。露茜一直感到恍恍忽忽的，過了好幾個鐘頭，她才醒轉過來，對羊怪說：\n「哦，圖姆納斯先生，打斷了你的演奏，實在抱歉。我非常喜歡這種曲調，可是我得回去了，真的，我本來只想逗留幾分鐘的。」\n「現在不行啊，你知道嗎？」羊怪說，他放下笛子，非常悲傷地對她搖了搖頭。\n「怎麼不行？」露茜被嚇得猛地跳了起來，「你說什麼？我要馬上回去。別人還以為我出了什麼事呢！」接著，她又問羊怪：「圖姆納斯先生，這究竟是怎麼一回事？」這時，羊怪那棕色的眼睛里噙滿了淚水，淚水沿著雙頰一滴一滴地往下淌，又從鼻尖底下滾落了下來。最後，他用雙手捂住了臉，號啕大哭起來。\n「圖姆納斯先生，圖姆納斯先生，」露茜感到很難過，「別哭！別哭！到底是怎麼回事？你哪兒不舒服嗎？親愛的圖姆納斯先生，你得告訴我呀！」但羊怪依舊哭個不停，好像他的心都要碎了似的。露茜走過去，雙手摟住了他，把她的手絹兒掏出來遞給他，他還是不停的抽泣。他接過手絹，一邊哭，一邊擦著眼淚，手絹濕的不能再用時就用雙手擰幾下，不一會兒，露茜腳下的一小塊地方就濕漉漉的了。\n「圖姆納斯先生！」露茜搖著他的身子，在他的耳邊大聲喊道，「停住，立即停住！你應該為自己感到羞愧，一個像你這樣偉大的農牧之神！究竟是什麼事情使你哭的這樣傷心？」\n「嗚，嗚，嗚。」圖姆納斯抽噎著，「我哭，因為我是這樣壞的一個農牧之神。」\n「不，你決不是一個壞的農牧之神。」露茜說，「你是一個非常好的農牧之神。你是我遇到過的最好的農牧之神。」\n「嗚，嗚，你如果知道了事情的真相，你就不會這樣說了。」圖姆納斯先生抽泣著回答，「我是一個壞的農牧之神。我想，從開天闢地以來，再也沒有一個比我更壞的農牧之神了。」\n「那麼你到底做了些什麼壞事？」露茜問。\n「我的年邁的父親，」圖姆納斯先生說，「你瞧，掛在壁爐台上面的就是他的畫像，就不會做出這樣的事來。」\n「什麼樣的事？」露茜問。\n「我所做的事，」羊怪回答，「是替白女巫效勞。我乾的就是這種事情，我是被白女巫收買的。」\n「白女巫？她是什麼人？」\n「哎喲，這還用問嗎？就是她，控制了整個那尼亞；就是她，使那尼亞全年都是冬天，從來沒有聖誕節，請你想想看，這是一種什麼樣的情景呀！」\n「多可怕呀！」露茜說，「但是她要你幹些什麼？」\n「她要我乾的是喪盡天良的事，」圖姆納斯先生長嘆一聲說，「我專門替她拐騙小孩，這就是我乾的勾當。夏娃的女兒，這你會相信嗎？我就是這樣的一個農牧之神，在森林裡遇到一個可憐的天真無辜的孩子以後，我就假裝和他交朋友，請他到我的洞里來，騙他睡熟以後，就把他給白女巫送去。」\n「這我不相信，」露茜說，「我能肯定，你不會做出這種事情來的。」\n「可是我已做了。」羊怪說。\n「嗯，」露茜的語調慢了下來（因為她不願撒謊，又不想對他過分嚴厲），「這確實是太沒有良心了。但是，你為此這樣的難過，我相信你決不會再做這樣的事了。」\n「夏娃的女兒，你還不明白嗎？」羊怪說，「這不是我以前干過的事，而是此刻我正在乾的事。」\n「你想幹什麼？」露茜尖叫一聲，臉色一下子變得煞白。\n「你就是那種孩子。」圖姆納斯先生說，「我早就從白女巫那裡得到命令，如果我在樹林里發現亞當和夏娃的兒女，我就必須把他們抓來，送交給她。你是我遇到的第一個孩子。我假裝和你交朋友，邀請你來吃茶點，我一直在等著，想等你睡熟以後，我就去向她報告。」\n「嗯，不過，你不會去報告的，對嗎？真的，真的，你千萬不能去告訴她啊！」\n「假如我不去告訴她，」說著，他又哭了起來，「她最後總會發現，她就要割去我的尾巴，鋸斷我的角，拔掉我的鬍子。她還會揮動她的魔杖打掉我這美麗的偶蹄，把它們變成像劣馬那樣可怕的單蹄。如果她惱羞成怒，她就會把我變成石頭，變成她那可怕的庭院里一座羊怪石像，直到凱爾·巴拉維爾的四個國王的寶座被人類佔去以後為止。可是，誰知道這樣的事情哪一天才能發生。到底是否會發生呢。」\n「非常對不起，圖姆納斯先生，」露茜說，「請你讓我回家吧。」\n「當然要讓你回家，」羊怪說，「我一定得這樣做。在遇見你以前，我不知道人類是什麼樣子。現在我明白了。既然認識了你，我就不能把你交給白女巫。但是我們必須立刻離開這兒。我把你送回到燈柱那兒。我想，到了那兒以後，你就可以找到回衣櫥和空屋的路了。」\n「我相信能找到的。」露茜說。\n「我們走的時候，儘可能不要有聲音，」圖姆納斯先生說，「整座森林都布滿了她的暗探，甚至有些樹木也站在她那邊。」\n他們站起身來，連茶具也沒有收拾，圖姆納斯先生又撐起了傘，讓露茜夾著，兩人出了門，走進了雪地里。他們一聲不響地抄著小路，從樹林中最隱蔽的地方急匆匆地跑著，一直跑到燈柱面前，露茜才鬆了一口氣。\n「夏娃的女兒，你認得從這裡回去的路嗎？」圖姆納斯問。\n露茜在樹林里仔細的看了看，瞧見遠方有一片亮光，看起來很像陽光。「認得。」她說，「我已看見了櫥門。」\n「那你就趕快走吧，」羊怪說，「還有，你——你肯原諒我本來想做的壞事嗎？」\n「說到哪裡去了，」露茜十分誠懇地握著他的手說，「我只是衷心地希望你不要因為我而遭到麻煩。」\n「再見了，夏娃的女兒。」他說，「這塊手絹可以讓我隨身帶走嗎？」\n「當然可以。」露茜說完，就急急忙忙向著遠處有亮光的地方飛奔過去。不一會，她就感到從她身上擦過的已不再是粗硬的樹枝而是柔軟的衣服了，她腳下也不是「嘎吱」「嘎吱」的雪，而是堅硬的木板了。一眨眼，她發現自己已離開了衣櫥，來到了原來的那間空屋——這一段奇異的經歷就是從這間空屋開始的。她緊緊地關上了櫥門，向四周張望了一下，不停地喘著粗氣。雨仍在下著，她清清楚楚地聽見他們還在走廊里說話呢。\n「我在這兒哪。」她高興喊著說，「我在這兒哪。我回來啦，平平安安地回來啦。」\n①夏娃——《聖經》故事中人類的始祖。據《創世紀》記載，上帝用泥土造人，取名亞當，並以亞當的骨頭造了他的妻子夏娃，把他們放在伊甸園中，後來兩人偷吃禁果犯罪，同被逐出伊甸園。"

  chinese_body: "正當兩個男孩在後面低聲談話的時候，兩個女孩突然「啊」地一聲停住了腳步。「知更鳥，」茜喊道，「知更鳥飛走啦！」它真的飛走了，一點蹤影也看不見了。\n「現在我們怎麼辦？」愛德蒙說，他看了彼得一眼，意思是說：「我是怎麼警告你的？我說得不錯吧！」\n「噓，你們看！」蘇珊說。\n「什麼？」彼得問。\n「那兒靠左邊點兒，樹林中有什麼東西在動。」\n他們拚命睜大眼睛搜索，看得眼睛都感到有點難受。\n過了一會兒，蘇珊說：「瞧，它又動起來了。」\n「這次我也看到了，」彼得說，「它還在那兒，這會兒跑到那棵大樹後面去了。」\n「那是什麼東西呀？」露茜問道，她竭力裝出不害怕的樣子。\n「誰知道它是什麼？」彼得說，「它老是躲著我們，就怕被人看見。」\n「我們回去吧。」蘇珊說。這時，雖然誰也沒有大聲說出來，但每個人都突然意識到剛才愛德蒙低聲對彼得講起的困難，他們迷路了。\n「它像什麼樣子呀？」露茜問。\n「它是，它是一種動物。」蘇珊說。過了一會兒，她又喊道：「你們快來看，快！它又出來啦！」\n這一次他們都看清楚了，一張長滿了絡腮鬍子的毛茸茸的臉，從一棵樹後面探出來看著他們。但這一回它並沒有立即縮回去，卻用它的爪子對著嘴巴，就好像人們把手指頭放在嘴唇上，示意別人安靜下來的樣子。然後它又消失了。孩子們都屏住呼吸，站在那兒。\n過了一會兒，這個奇怪的動物又從那棵樹後面出來。它向四周看了一下，好像害怕有人注意似的，向他們「噓」了一聲，並打著手勢，招呼他們到它所在的那塊密林中去，接著它又消失了。\n「我知道它是什麼。」彼得說，「它是海狸，我已看見了它的尾巴。」\n「它要我們到那裡去，」蘇珊說，「它叫我們別做聲。」\n「這我知道。」彼得說，「問題是我們去還是不去？璐，你看怎麼樣？」\n「我看這隻海狸很老實。」露茜說。\n「真的嗎，我們是怎麼知道的呢？」愛德蒙問。\n「我們得冒一次險。」蘇珊說，「我是說，老站在這兒沒有用。我肚子餓了。」\n這時，海狸又突然從樹后探出頭來，向他們誠懇地點頭示意。\n「來吧，」彼得說，「讓我們試它一試。我們都靠緊點兒，如果海狸是敵人，我們就跟它干一仗。」\n於是，孩子們緊靠在一起，朝著那棵樹走過去，一直走到樹後面海狸原先站的地方，但海狸卻從那裡又繼續朝後退去了。它壓低了嗓門用一種嘶啞的聲音對他們說：「往裡，再往裡，到我這兒來，在外面有危險。」它把他們一直引到一個非常幽暗的地方。那裡有四棵樹緊挨在一起，樹枝與樹枝連成一片，雪落不到下面來，因而地上可以看見褐色的泥土和松針。他們到了這兒以後，海狸才開始和他們說話。\n「你們是亞當的兒子和夏娃的女兒嗎？」它問。\n「是的。」彼得答道。\n「噓——」海狸說，「聲音不要太大，即使在這兒，我們還是不夠安全。」\n「哎呀，你怕誰？」彼得說，「這裡除了我們以外，再也沒旁的人了。」\n「這裡有樹。」海狸說，「它們老把耳朵豎著。它們當中絕大多數站在我們一邊，但也有背叛我們倒向她那一邊的，你們知道我說的是倒向誰嗎？」它接連點了好幾下頭。\n「要是說到兩邊的話，」愛德蒙說，「我們怎們知道你是朋友而不是敵人？」\n「請你別見怪，海狸先生，」彼得解釋說，「你看，我們彼此之間還不熟悉呢。」\n「對，對，」海狸說，「我這裡有一樣紀念品。」說著，它就拿出一件白色的小東西。孩子們都驚訝地注視著。突然，露茜說道：「哦，這是我的手帕，是我送給可憐的圖姆納斯先生的。」\n「不錯，」海狸說，「我可憐的夥伴，他在被捕以前聽到了風聲，就把這手帕交給我，說如果他有什麼意外，我就必須在這個地方與你們會面，並領你們到……」說到這裡，海狸的聲音低得聽不見了。它非常神秘的向孩子們點點頭，又向他們做了一下手勢，叫他們盡量靠近它站著，以致孩子們的臉都碰到了它的鬍子，感到痒痒的。它低聲地補充說：\n「據說阿斯蘭正在活動，也許已經登陸了。」\n現在，一種非常奇怪的現象發生了。這些孩子們和你一樣，一點也不知道阿蘭斯是誰。但海狸一提起阿蘭斯，他們每個人身上就有一種異樣的感覺。也許有時你在夢中碰到過類似的情況。往往你在白天聽到一樣新鮮事情，到了夢中，它的意義就大得非常出奇——不是導致一場可怕的噩夢，就是美好的無法用語言表達，使你終身難忘，巴不得能不斷重溫這個美夢。現在的情況就是這樣。一聽到阿蘭斯的名字，每個孩子都感到心裡有一樣東西在躍動。愛德蒙感到有一種莫名其妙的恐懼，彼得感到突然變得無所畏懼了，蘇珊感到有一種芬芳的氣息和一首美妙動聽的樂曲在她身旁蕩漾，露茜呢，感到特別興奮和喜悅，就像你在某一個早上醒來想到假期或夏季就要從今天開始時的心情一樣。\n「你談談圖姆納斯先生的情況吧。」露茜說，「他在哪兒？」\n「噓——」海狸說，「這兒還不是說話的地方，我必須帶你們到一個可以交談和吃飯的去處。」\n現在除了愛德蒙以外，誰也不懷疑海狸了，每個人包括愛德蒙在內都很高興聽到「吃飯」這個詞兒。所以，他們全都跟在這位新朋友後面急急忙忙地朝前走去了。海狸的速度快的令人吃驚，領著他們在森林裡最濃密的地方走了一個多小時。正當大家感到疲憊不堪、飢餓難忍的時候，前面的樹木變得稀疏了，地面的坡度也變陡了。向下沒走幾步，他們就走出了樹林。頭頂上是晴朗蔚藍的天空，太陽依舊照耀著，舉目四望，冰清玉潔，風光如畫。\n他們現在站在一個又陡又狹的山谷邊上，要不是封凍，谷底準會是一條洶湧澎湃的大河。就在他們腳下，有一條水壩穿河而過。他們一看見水壩，就猛地想到海狸很會築壩，而且他們幾乎可以肯定，腳下的這條水壩就是這位海狸先生築的。他們也注意到，它的臉上露出一種特別謙虛的表情，就像你去參觀人家的一個園地或閱讀人家寫的一本書時，你所看到的園丁或作者本人常有的那種表情一樣。蘇珊說：「這條水壩築的多好啊！」海狸先生這一次沒有說「別做聲」，卻連聲說：「只不過是個小玩意兒！只不過是個小玩意兒！它還沒有全部完成呢！」當然，海狸這樣說只是出於慣常的禮貌。\n在壩的上游一側，原來是個很深的水池，而現在一眼看去卻是一片平坦的暗綠色的冰池。壩的下游一側要低得多，結的冰更多，但不像上游那樣平滑，全部凍成了泡沫的形狀，現出波浪起伏的樣子，原來，在河流結冰以前，河水過壩以後就是這樣飛奔而下，濺起無數的浪花。壩的一側在原先漫水和過水的地方現在成了一堵閃閃發光的冰牆，上面好像掛滿了許多晶瑩潔白的鮮花、花環和花冠。在大壩的中間，有一間十分有趣的小屋，樣子就像一個巨大的蜂箱，這時從屋頂的一個洞中正冒出炊煙。所以你一看到它，特別是在肚子餓得咕咕叫的時候，你就會立刻想到已經有什麼東西煮在鍋里了，肚子就會餓得更慌。\n這些是其他三個孩子看到的主要情景，而愛德蒙卻注意到了別的東西。順著這條河流往下不遠的地方，還有一條小河，它是從另外一個小山谷里流出來和這條大河匯合的。愛德蒙抬頭向那個山谷望去，看見有兩座小山，他幾乎能肯定，它們就是那天白女巫與他在燈柱那兒分別時指給他看的那兩座小山。他想，那兩座小山之間一定就是她的宮殿，離他大約只有一英里遠，甚至還不到。他想起了土耳其軟糖，想起了當國王（「我不知道彼得將會怎樣喜歡這些東西呢？」他暗暗問自己），一個可怕的念頭在他的頭腦里產生了。\n「我們馬上就要到家啦，」海狸說，「看來我的太太正等著我們呢。好，我來帶路，但是請大家小心點兒，不要滑倒。」\n壩頂相當寬，上面完全可以走路，但是對人類來說，終究有些不便，因為上面覆蓋著冰雪，另外，朝下看看，雖然結滿了冰的水池是平坦的，但在另一側，落差還很大，有些怕人。海狸先生領著他們成單行走到壩的中間。站在這裡他們可以看到。沿著那條河流向上有一條很長的路，沿著河流向下也有一條很長的路。他們一到壩的中間，就到了那間小屋的門口了。\n「我們回來啦，太太，」海狸先生說，「我找到他們了。他們就是亞當和夏娃的兒女。」說著，把他們全讓進了屋。\n露茜走進屋，立刻聽到一種「咔嚓」「咔嚓」的聲音，看到一個面容慈祥的海狸老媽媽。她嘴裡咬著一根線，坐在角落裡，正忙著踏縫紉機，那種「咔嚓」「咔嚓」的聲音就是從縫紉機上發出來的。孩子們一進屋，她隨即就把手中的活兒停了下來，起身迎接。\n「終於把你們盼來啦！」她伸出兩隻滿是皺紋的蒼老的爪子說，「你們終於來啦！我做夢也沒有想到我還能看到這一天！土豆煮在鍋里，水壺已經響了，哎，海狸先生，你替我搞些鮮魚回來才好哩！」\n「行，我就去。」海狸先生說著，提了一個桶，就走出了屋子，彼得也跟著一起走了。他們越過結滿冰的深池，來到一個地方，這裡冰上有一個小窟窿，這是海狸每天用斧子鑿開的。\n海狸先生靜悄悄地往洞邊一坐（天這麼冷，他似乎也不在乎），目不轉睛地注視著洞里的河水，突然，他把爪子伸進水中，說時遲，那時快，它一下子就逮住了一條漂亮的鱒魚①。就這樣，他一連逮到了許多好魚。\n在海狸和彼得出去捕魚的時候，兩個女孩子幫助海狸太太把水壺灌滿，收拾吃飯桌子，切麵包，熱菜，又從屋角的一個桶中替海狸先生舀出一大杯啤酒。最後，他們把煎魚的鍋子放到爐子上，倒進油燒熱。露茜認為，海狸夫婦的家雖然完全不像圖姆納斯先生的窯洞，卻也非常小巧舒適。室內沒有書，沒有畫，兩個牆洞便是他們的床，看上去就像輪船上倚壁而設的地鋪一樣。屋頂下面掛著火腿和一串串的洋蔥，靠牆放著膠靴、油布、斧子、羊毛剪、鏟、泥刀、和其他運灰泥的工具，還有釣魚竿、魚網和魚簍。桌上的檯布雖然粗糙，卻很乾凈。\n正當油鍋嘶嘶響的時候，彼得和海狸先生拎著魚回來了，這些魚海狸先生已經在外面用刀剖開洗凈。你們一定能想象到現捕的魚放在鍋中煎的時候味道有多美，肚子餓得咕嚕咕嚕叫的孩子們又是多麼希望它們早點煎好，而在海狸太太說「我們馬上就開飯」以前，他們已是餓得十分厲害了。蘇珊把土豆濾干后又把它們放回爐口的空鍋里去烤，露茜幫海狸太太把鱒魚盛進盤中。這樣，不到幾分鐘，大家就把凳子擺好，準備吃飯了（海狸家裡除了放在灶邊供海狸太太坐的特製的搖椅以外，都是三條腿的凳子）。有一罐子牛奶專門給孩子們喝（海狸先生只喝啤酒），桌子中間放著一大塊深黃色的奶油，吃土豆的時候，奶油由各人隨意自取。孩子們都認為——我也同意他們的看法——當你吃著半小時以前還活著，半分鐘以前從鍋里盛出來的魚時，是沒有任何食品能夠和它比美的。魚吃完以後，海狸太太出乎大家意外地從爐子里拿出熱氣騰騰的黏糊糊的果醬捲兒。同時，把水壺移到爐子上。所以孩子們吃好果醬卷以後，茶就已經準備好了。孩子們喝了茶，又把凳子往後移動了一下，靠牆倚著，心滿意足地舒了一口氣。\n「現在，」海狸先生把空啤酒杯往旁邊一推，把茶杯拿到面前說：「請你們等我抽袋煙，好嗎？不用說，我們現在可以著手干我們的事了。天又下起雪來啦，」他抬頭望了望窗外繼續說道，」這就更好了，雪一下，就不會有人來找我們了；另外，如果有人想跟蹤你們的話，他也發現不了你們的任何足跡。」\n①鱒魚：背部淡青略帶褐色，側線下部銀白色，全身有黑點。"

  chinese_body: "因為彼得和蘇珊還在捉迷藏，所以愛德蒙和露茜花了好長時間才找到他倆。當大家一起聚集到放有盔甲的那間狹長屋子裡以後，露茜大聲說：\n「彼得！蘇珊！一點也不錯，愛德蒙也看見了，那裡有一個國家，可以從衣櫥裡邊進去。愛德蒙和我進去過了，把所有的情況都告訴他們。」\n「艾德，這到底是怎麼一回事？」彼得問。\n現在我們寫到這個故事中最令人不愉快的部分。在這以前，愛德蒙一直感到很不舒服，一直在生露茜的氣，但對露茜究竟採取什麼行動，他一時還沒有拿定主意。現在彼得突如其來地問起他這個問題，他就把心一橫，決定干出他所能想到的最不光彩的事情，來整一下露茜。\n「告訴我們吧，艾德。」蘇珊說。\n艾德顯出老成持重的樣子，好像他比露茜要大得多(實際上兩人只相差一歲)。他噗嗤一笑說：「噢，對啦，露茜和我一直在做遊戲，她故意說上次講的衣櫥里有個國家的故事是真的。當然嘍，我們只是開開玩笑，其實，那兒什麼東西也沒有。」\n可憐的露茜看了愛德蒙一眼，便一口氣奔到了屋外。\n愛德蒙現在變得越來越不像話了，他自以為已經取得了極大的成功，立刻接下去說道：「她又去啦，她是中了魔法還是怎麼的？小孩子就是愛胡鬧，他們老是……」\n「聽我說，」彼得轉過身來，兩眼盯住了他，十分氣憤地說：「住口！自從她上次瞎扯了一些衣櫥的事以來，你對她總是凶聲凶氣的，現在你跟她一起躲進了衣櫥里做遊戲，又把她氣走了。我看，你這樣做完全不懷好意。」\n「但她講的通通都是胡說八道。」愛德蒙說，彼得的話使他大吃一驚。\n「當然都是胡言亂語，」彼得說，「問題的嚴重性就在這裡。在家的時候，璐是好好的，但到了鄉下以後，她看上去要麼神經不很正常，要麼就是謊話連篇。但無論是哪種情況，你想想看，你今天嘲笑她，對她喋喋不休說個不停，明天你又去慫恿她，這對她有什麼幫助？」\n「我原來想，我原來……」愛德蒙說，可是他又想不出說什麼好。\n「你想什麼來著，」彼得說，「你盡想壞主意。你對比你小的孩子總喜歡這一套，我們以前在學校里就經常看到你這樣。」\n「別說了，」蘇珊說，「你們互相埋怨又有什麼用處?我們還是去找找露茜吧。」\n他們找了好長一段時間，才找到了露茜。果然不出大家所料，她正哭的傷心。無論他們怎麼說，露茜都堅持她說的情況是真的。\n「不管你們怎麼想，也不管你們怎麼說，我都無所謂。你們可以去告訴教授，也可以寫信告訴媽媽，隨便你們怎麼做都可以。我只知道我在那裡碰見了一個農牧之神。我要是留在那裡多好啊！你們凈欺侮人。」\n這是一個十分不愉快的夜晚。露茜感到很委屈，愛德蒙也開始感到，他的計劃並沒有像他預料的那樣奏效。那兩個年齡大些的孩子卻真以為露茜的精神不大正常。在她入睡以後很久，他們還站在走廊里小聲議論著。\n第二天早上，他們決定把全部情況都告訴教授。「假如他也認為露茜真的有什麼毛病，他將寫信去告訴爸爸，」彼得說，「我們可管不了這樣的事。」於是，他們就去敲老教授書房的門。教授說了聲「請進」，便站起身來，找了椅子讓他們坐下，還說有事儘管來找他，他樂意為他們效勞。然後他坐下來，將手指合攏，靜靜地聽他們把整個故事講完。聽完以後，他好長時間沒有吭聲，最後他清了清嗓子，出乎意外地問道：\n「你們怎能斷定露茜講的故事就不是真的呢？」\n「哦，，但是……」蘇珊剛想開口又停住了。從老人的臉色可以看出，他是十分嚴肅的。過了一會兒，蘇珊鼓起了勇氣說：「但是愛德蒙親口告訴我們，他們只是假裝說說玩的。」\n「有一個關鍵問題倒值得你們仔細考慮，」教授說，「根據你們的經驗——請原諒我提出這個問題——你們認為誰更誠實一些，是你們的弟弟，還是你們的妹妹？」\n「這真是一個十分有趣的問題，先生，」彼得說，「直到現在為止，我應該說，露茜要比愛德蒙誠實。」\n「你認為怎樣呢，我親愛的孩子？」教授轉過頭來又問蘇珊。\n「嗯，」蘇珊說，「我嘛，基本上和彼得的看法相同。但關於森林和農牧之神的故事總不可能是真的。」\n「這個問題我就不清楚了，」教授說，「但是，隨口指責一個你們都認為是誠實的人說謊，這倒是一個非常嚴重的問題。」\n「我們擔心的倒不是露茜說謊，」蘇珊說，「我們認為很可能露茜精神有了毛病。」\n「你的意思是說她發了瘋？」教授非常冷靜地說，「嗯，這個你們很容易判斷。你們只要觀察觀察她的臉色，再和她交談交談，就可以斷定出來了。」\n「但是……」蘇珊剛開口又不說了。她做夢也沒想到像教授這樣的大人會說出這種話來，她真被搞糊塗了。\n「邏輯！」教授多半自言自語地說，「現在這些學校為什麼不教你們一點邏輯呢？這件事只有三種可能：或是你們的妹妹說了謊，或者是她精神不正常，要不，她講的就是真話。你們都說她向來不說謊，她的精神又沒有什麼問題。那麼在發現更充分的證據之前，我們就只能假定她講的是真實的。」\n蘇珊兩眼緊盯著他，從他臉上的表情，她可以肯定他不是在和他們開玩笑。\n「但是，這怎麼可能呢，先生？」彼得問。\n「為什麼就一定不可能呢？」教授反問了一句。\n「因為，」彼得說，「假如是真的，為什麼不是每個人每次到櫥里都能發現那個國家呢？有一次，我們到櫥里看的時候，根本沒有發現什麼別的情況，還是露茜親自領著我們去看的呢，她自己也沒有說她看到了旁的東西。」\n「這有什麼關係呢？」教授說。\n「有關係，先生。如果是真的，那些東西就應該始終都在那裡。」\n「始終？」教授問道，彼得不知如何回答才完全正確。\n「但是露茜躲在櫥里只有一眨眼工夫，」蘇珊說，「即使櫥里有這麼一個地方，她也不曾有時間去呀。我們剛從空屋裡出來，她就跟在我們後面溜出來了，前後還不到一分鐘，她卻硬是說離開了好幾個鐘頭。」\n「正因為如此，她說的故事才更像真的，」教授說，「如果這間屋裡真的有一個門通向某一個別的世界(我得提醒你們，這是一棟非常神秘的房屋，即使是我，對它也了解很少)——就算她真的到了另一個世界，那我們也不應該感到奇怪，那個世界一定有它自己的時間概念，所以不管你在那兒逗留多久，也不會佔去我們這個世界的任何一點時間。另外我還認為，像她這樣年齡的女孩子，是不可能自己編造出這樣的故事來的。假如她想說謊，她就會在裡面多藏一段時間，然後再出來講她的故事。」\n「先生，你是說，「彼得問道，「在這棟房屋裡，譬如說，就在附近，到處都有可能有別的世界嗎？」\n「這是非常可能的，」教授說，他一邊摘下眼鏡擦擦乾淨，一邊又自言自語，「我真不懂，這些孩子在學校里，到底學了些什麼東西？」\n「這叫我們怎麼辦？」蘇珊說，她感到這場談話已經開始離題了。\n「孩子們，」教授突然抬起頭來，用一種非常嚴肅的神情看著他倆說，「有一個計劃值得一試，但誰也沒有提起過。」\n「什麼計劃？」蘇珊問。\n「這個我們就別去管它了。」他說。那次談話就這樣結束了。彼得做了許多工作，使愛德蒙不再嘲笑露茜，她和別人都不想再談衣櫥的事，這已成了使人不快的話題。所以，在相當長的一段時間裡，一切奇遇似乎都已成了過去，但事實卻並不如此。\n教授的這棟房屋——即使他自己，也了解得很少——是這樣古老，又是這樣聞名，全國各地的人都常常要求來此參觀，這所房屋在旅遊指南一類的書上，甚至在歷史書上，都有所記載，在各式各樣的故事中都談到過，其中有些故事比我現在對你講的這個故事還要離奇。每當觀光的人要求進屋看看的時候，教授總是滿口答應，女管家瑪卡蕾蒂太太就帶領著他們到各處轉轉，給他們介紹畫兒啦，盔甲啦，以及圖書館里稀有的書籍啦。瑪卡蕾蒂太太不很喜歡孩子，當她給客人們滔滔不絕地講述她所知道的各種掌故時，她是不喜歡別人從旁邊插嘴打擾的。幾乎在孩子們來的第一天早上，她就向蘇珊和彼得交代說(同時還交待了許多別的規矩)：「請你們記著，我領人參觀的時候，你們要躲遠一點兒。」\n「就好像我們當中會有人故意要跟一群陌生的大人浪費半天似的。」愛德蒙說。其餘三人也有同樣的想法。誰知，第二次奇遇就是由此引起的。\n幾天以後，彼得和愛德蒙正望著那副盔甲出神，想試試能否把它拆卸下來，兩個女孩忽然奔進屋裡說：「不好啦，瑪卡蕾蒂帶著一群人來了！」\n「真糟糕！」彼得說，四個人很快就從另外一頭的門溜掉了。他們溜出來以後先進了那間休息室，後來又跑到了圖書館，這時他們突然聽到前面有說話的聲音，他們都以為瑪卡蕾蒂太太帶著觀光的人群到后樓去了，而沒有像他們預料的那樣到前樓來。以後，不知是他們自己昏了頭，還是瑪卡蕾蒂太太要來抓他們，還是這所住宅的魔力再次顯現，要把他們趕往那尼亞，他們似乎感到每到一處都有人跟蹤著。最後，蘇珊說：「啊，這些遊客真夠討厭！喂，讓我們躲到放衣櫥的那間空屋裡去吧，等他們走了以後再說，誰也不會跟我們到那兒去的。」但他們剛進空屋，就聽見走廊里有人在講話，接著又是摸門的聲音，一看，門把手已在移動了。\n「趕快！」彼得說，「沒有別的地方可躲了！」他猛地一下推開了櫥門。四個人蜷縮在黑咕隆咚的衣櫥裡邊，不停地喘氣。彼得帶上了櫥門，但並沒有把它關緊，因為，像每一個有理智的人一樣，他懂得，一個人怎麼可以把自己關在衣櫥裡面呢？"

  chinese_body: "愛德蒙在這段時間裡卻過得大失所望。小矮人去準備雪橇時，他本來希望妖婆會好好款待他，就像他們上次見面時那樣。誰知她什麼也沒說。最後當愛德蒙鼓起勇氣說，「請別見怪，陛下，能給我一些土耳其軟糖嗎？你——你——說——」她回答說，「安靜，笨蛋！」後來她又像改變主意了，彷彿自言自語地說，「讓這個小崽子昏倒在路上總是不行的。」說著她又一次拍拍手，又來了一個小矮人。\n「給這個人拿點吃喝的東西來。」她說。\n小矮人走開了，不一會兒就拿來一隻鐵碗，裡面盛了點水，還有一隻鐵盤子，上面放了一大塊乾麵包。他把東西放在愛德蒙身邊的地板上，還咧嘴一笑，那副神情實在令人厭惡，他說：\n「小王子的土耳其軟糖來了。哈！哈！哈！」\n「把它拿走，」愛德蒙生氣地說，「我不要吃乾麵包。」不料妖婆突然向他撲來，臉上的神情那麼可怕，他只好賠個不是，一點點啃起那塊麵包來，可是麵包太干，他簡直咽不下\n「在你再吃到麵包之前，有這個吃你該高興。」妖婆說。他還在那兒咬啊嚼啊，第一個小矮人已回來報告雪橇準備好了。白妖婆站起來就走，同時命令愛德蒙跟她一塊兒去。他們走到院子里時，雪又下起來了，但她對此並不在意，還叫愛德蒙到雪橇上坐在她身邊。臨出發前她又招呼芬瑞斯·烏爾夫，它就像條大狗似的跳到雪橇旁邊。\n「你帶上跑得最快的狼，馬上到海狸家裡去。」妖婆說，「你們在那兒不管找到什麼，統統都殺掉。如果他們已經走了，那就全速趕到石桌去，但別給人看見。你們躲在那兒等著我。我得向西走好多英里，才找得到一個能駕雪橇過河的地方。你可以趁那些人沒到達石桌前先趕上他們。要是找到了他們，你總知道該怎麼干！」\n「遵命，女王。」那隻狼吼道，說著立刻飛奔到黑暗的雪地里，就像駿馬騰空那麼快。轉眼工夫它又叫來一隻狼，一起奔向堤壩，在海狸夫婦的房子里四處嗅聞。不過房子當然是空的。要是那天晚上天氣一直很好，對海狸夫婦和孩子們倒是禍害了，因為狼會跟蹤他們的足跡——十之八九在他們進洞以前就會趕上他們。但這會兒又開始下雪了，氣味也淡了，連腳印也都給淹沒了。\n同時小矮人趕著馴鹿，跟妖婆和愛德蒙出了拱門，然後一路向黑暗的冰天雪地里駛去。對愛德蒙來說這可真是一次可怕的旅程，因為他沒有大衣。他們走了還不到一刻鐘，他面前就積滿了雪—一會兒他就不再撣雪花了，因為儘管他撣得快，剛撣掉就又積起一堆來，而且他很累。不一會兒他就渾身濕透了。哦，他多慘啊。目前看來妖婆並不打算給他當國王了啊！他為了讓自己相信她是好人，善心人，她這一邊才是真正正義的一邊，而對自己說過的種種話，如今聽起來都是些蠢話了。他願意放棄一切，這會兒就去找大家——甚至彼得！如今惟一能安慰他自己的辦法就是盡量相信這整個事件是場夢，他隨時會醒過來。他們走啊走啊，過了一個小時又一個小時，似乎真成為一場夢了。\n這一路上花的時間長得很，哪怕我再寫上多少頁也寫不完。不過我就跳過這一段，先說說這時雪停了，天亮了，他們在陽光下飛駛著。他們還在繼續趕路，除了雪地上不斷的嗖嗖聲，馴鹿挽具的嘎吱聲，什麼聲音也沒有。最後，妖婆終於說：「我們看看這兒有什麼？停下！」他們這才停下了。\n愛德蒙多麼希望她開口說說吃早飯的事！可是她停下來的理由卻完全不同。離雪橇不遠的一棵樹下坐著快快樂樂的一夥：松鼠夫婦和孩子，還有兩個森林神，一個小矮人．一隻老雄狐，全都圍著桌子坐在矮凳上。愛德蒙看不清他們在吃什麼，不過味道聞起來真香，而且似乎還用了冬青做裝飾，他簡直不敢相信自己看見了葡萄乾布丁之類的東西。雪橇停下時，那隻狐狸，顯然是在場年紀最老的，剛剛站起身來，右爪舉起一隻杯子，似乎要說些什麼。但等這一夥看到雪橇停下，是誰乘在上頭時，大家臉上的歡樂神情就全部消失了。松鼠爸爸的叉子舉到嘴邊，半途就停下不吃了。還有一個森林神嘴裡含著叉子就停下了，松鼠娃娃都嚇得吱吱叫。\n「這是什麼意思？」妖婆女王問道。沒人回答。\n「說呀，壞蛋，」她又說，「難道你們想要我的小矮人用鞭子叫你們開口嗎？你們大吃大喝，鋪張浪費，縱情歡樂，是什麼意思？這一切東西你們究竟從哪兒弄來的？」\n「你別見怪，陛下，」狐理說，「這些都是給我們的。請恕我冒昧，讓我為陛下的健康乾杯——」\n「這些東西是誰給你們的？」妖婆問。\n「聖誕老——老——老人。」狐狸結結巴巴地說。\n「什麼？」妖婆吼道，從雪橇上一躍而起，向那些受驚的動物走近幾大步。「他沒到這兒來過，他決不會到這兒來！你們竟敢——可是不。說你們是在說謊，那麼就可以寬恕你們。」\n這時一隻小松鼠竟然完全昏了頭。\n「他來過了——他來過了——他來過了！」一面吱吱叫著，一面用小匙敲桌子。\n愛德蒙看見妖婆咬咬嘴唇，雪白的臉蛋上沁出一滴血。接著她舉起了魔杖。\n「哦，別，別，請不要。」愛德蒙叫道，但就在他大聲喊叫時，她已經揮動了魔杖，剛才一群動物歡宴的地方，立刻出現了一個個動物的石像(其中一隻就永遠舉著石叉凝固在離嘴一半的地方)，圍坐在一張石桌前，桌上是石盤和石頭的葡萄乾布丁。\n「至於你，」妖婆說，重新坐上雪橇時給了他一下耳光，打得他昏頭昏腦，「這就是你替姦細和叛徒求情的教訓。上路！」在這個故事中愛德蒙還是第一次為別人感到難過呢。想到那些小小的石像就此坐在那兒度過寂靜的白天、黑暗的夜晚，日復一日，年復一年，直到身上長滿苔蘚，最後甚至臉部也會分解，這似乎太可憐了。\n這會兒他們又穩穩地飛駛向前。不久愛德蒙就注意到他們衝過去時濺起的雪比昨晚濕多了。同時他也注意到自己已經不大覺得冷了。天變得霧蒙蒙的。事實上，霧氣越來越濃，天也越來越暖和。雪橇也遠遠沒有原來行駛得那麼快了。開頭，他以為這是因為拉雪橇的馴鹿累了，但不久他就看出這不是真正的原因。雪橇猛地一動，朝邊上滑去，還不斷顛簸，就像撞上了石頭。儘管小矮人鞭打可憐的馴鹿，雪橇還是越來越慢。他們周圍似乎還有種怪異的聲音，但雪橇行駛和顛簸的聲音，加上小矮人吆喝馴鹿的聲音，響得愛德蒙沒法聽清楚，直到後來雪橇突然困住了，寸步不能動彈。出了這事以後，一時四下寂靜。愛德蒙總算能好好聽一聽那聲音了。原來那是一種又奇特又可愛的沙沙聲、潺潺聲——但畢竟也不算太奇特，因為他知道自己以前聽見過這種聲音——要是他想得起在哪兒聽見的就好了！接著他突然想起來了。那是流水聲。雖然看不見，但就在他們周圍，那是小溪潺潺歡唱，水流淙淙，噗噗冒泡，水花四濺，甚至(遠處)激流咆哮。等他明白嚴冬已過，他心頭也猛地一跳(雖然他壓根不知道為什麼)。離他們更近的樹木的枝幹上都在滴滴答答地滴水。隨後，當他看著一棵樹時，他看見一大塊積雪從樹上滑落下來，這是他進入納尼亞以來第一次看見一棵冷杉樹的深綠色。但他沒時間多聽多看，因為妖婆說話了。\n「別坐在那兒乾瞪眼，笨蛋！來幫個忙。」\n愛德蒙當然只好服從。他踩到雪地里——不過目前這兒都是成雪水了——開始幫小矮人把雪橇從陷進去的泥潭裡拉出來。他們終於把雪橇拉了出來，小矮人對馴鹿十分兇狠，雪橇總算又動了，他們又走了一小段路。這會兒雪真的完全融化了，四面八方都出現了一小塊一小塊的綠草地。除非你也像愛德蒙那樣長時間看著一片冰雪世界，否則很難想象看了無窮無盡的白雪之後，看到那一片片綠地，心情有多麼欣慰。此時雪橇又停下了。\n「不行啊，陛下，」小矮人說，「我們在融雪中沒法駕雪橇。」\n「那我們就得走。」妖婆說。\n「走著去我們永遠也趕不上他們，」小矮人咕噥道，「他們先走一步。」\n「你是我的顧問還是我的奴隸啊！」妖婆說，「照我說的辦。把這個人的手綁在身後，拉住繩子一頭。再帶上你的鞭子。把馴鹿的挽具割斷，它們自己會找到路回家。」\n小矮人服從命令，不一會兒愛德蒙就被反綁著雙手，被迫儘快趕路。他不斷滑倒在雪水中、泥漿里和濕草地上，每次他一滑倒，小矮人就罵他，有時還給他一鞭子。妖婆走在小矮人後面，嘴裡不停地說：「快點！快點！」\n塊塊綠地隨時隨刻都在變大，塊塊雪地都在縮小。隨時隨刻都有更多的樹木脫下雪袍。不久，你無論朝哪兒看，白色都不見了，只見深綠的冷杉樹，光禿禿的橡樹那黑色多刺的樹枝，以及山毛櫸和榆樹。接著薄霧由白色轉為金色，一會兒就完全消失了。道道美妙的陽光射向森林的地面，從當頭的樹梢之間可以看到一片藍天。\n不久發生了更奇妙的事情。他們突然繞過一個拐角，來到一片銀白色的白樺樹林中的空地，愛德蒙看見空地上四面八方都開滿了黃色的小花——白苣菜。水聲更響了。不一會兒他們果真穿過了一條小河。他們還發現河邊長出了雪蓮花。\n「少管閑事！」小矮人說，他看見愛德蒙扭頭看花，就惡毒地用力拉拉繩子。\n不過這當然阻止不了愛德蒙觀看。只過了五分鐘他就注意到一棵老樹腳下長著十幾朵藏紅花——有金色的、紫色的和白色的。接著又傳來了一種比水聲更美妙的聲音。在他們走的那條小路附近，一隻鳥突然在樹枝上吱吱叫了起來。不遠處另一隻鳥兒喳喳叫著回答。此後，彷彿聽到信號似的，四面八方都唧唧喳喳叫個不停。一時間滿耳都是鳥鳴聲。不到五分鐘，鳥的音樂響徹了整個樹林，愛德蒙不論往哪兒看，都看得見一隻只鳥兒或落在樹枝上，或在空中飛翔，或喧鬧不休。\n「快點！快點！」妖婆說。\n這會兒霧已經消失得無影無蹤，天空變得越來越藍，不時還有幾片白雲匆匆掠過。寬闊的林間空地上開著朵朵櫻草花。一陣微風吹過，搖曳的樹枝上露珠紛紛灑落，拂來清涼、美妙的香味。樹木都開始活過來了。落葉松和白樺樹披上了綠裝，金蓮花金光燦燦。不久山毛櫸就長出了嬌嫩、透明的葉子。行人在樹下走過，光線也變成綠色的了。一隻蜜蜂嗡嗡叫著穿過他們走的那條小徑。\n「這不是融雪，」小矮人說著突然停下，「這是春天。我們怎麼辦？說真的，你的冬天已經給趕跑了。這是阿斯蘭乾的。」\n「如果你們有誰再提起那個名字，」妖婆說，「就叫他立刻送命。」"

  chinese_body: "露茜從空屋裡奔出來，一口氣跑到走廊里，找到了另外三個人。\n「好啦，好啦。」她連聲說，「我可回來啦！」\n「露茜，你大驚小怪些什麼？」蘇珊問。\n「啊？」露茜感到很驚異，「你們幹嗎不問問我到哪裡去過？」\n「你躲起來了，是不是？」彼得說，「可憐的璐啊，你就躲這麼一會兒，誰也不會理你。如果你想要別人來找你，你就得躲上更長的時間。」\n「但是我已到那裡去了好幾個鐘頭啦！」露茜說。\n三個人都驚訝地瞪起了眼睛，我看看你，你看看我。\n「發瘋啦！」愛德蒙拍著他的腦袋瓜說，「真是發瘋啦！」\n「你到底說什麼來著，璐？」彼得問道。\n「我是說，「露茜回答道，「吃了早點以後，我走進了衣櫥，我在裡邊呆了好幾個鐘頭，人家請我吃了茶點，我還遇到了許多奇怪的事。」\n「別說傻話，露茜，」蘇珊說，「我們剛從空屋裡出來，你躲在哪裡就這麼一會兒工夫。」\n「她一點兒也不傻，」彼得說，「她是在編造一個很有趣的故事，是嗎，露茜？這有什麼不好呢？」\n「不，彼得，我不是編故事。」她辯解說，「這是一個非常神秘的衣櫥，裡面有一座森林，正在下著雪，那裡有一個農牧之神和一個女巫，那個國家叫那尼亞，你們來看吧。」\n她這麼一說，其餘的人更加莫名其妙了，但露茜越說越激動，他們就都跟她一起回到了屋裡。她急匆匆地搶先推開了櫥門說：「喏，你們自己進去看吧。」\n「你這個笨蛋，」蘇珊把頭伸進櫥里，把皮衣向兩邊撥開說，「這隻不過是一個普通的衣櫥，瞧，那兒不是衣櫥的後壁嗎！」\n大家都朝衣櫥里仔細地觀察了一番，把皮衣撥開以後，他們都看見——露茜自己也看見——這完全是一隻普通的衣櫥。裡面沒有樹林，也沒有雪，只有衣櫥的後壁，上面釘著一些衣鉤。彼得跨進衣櫥里，用手指頭輕輕地敲了敲，證實這確實是衣櫥的後壁。\n「你真會說謊啊，璐。」他一邊走出來，一邊說，「我得承認，我們真的被你騙了，我們幾乎聽信你說的話。」\n「我一點兒也沒說謊，」露茜說，「的的確確是真的，剛才的情況不是這樣。我敢發誓，這是真的。」\n「你過來，璐，」彼得說，「這樣就更不對了，你說了謊，還不想改正。」\n露茜急得滿臉通紅，她想爭辯，但又不知說什麼好，忽然，她大聲哭了起來。\n以後接連好幾天，露茜一直悶悶不樂。如果她不顧事實隨口承認這個故事只是編出來讓大家開開心的，那她就很容易隨時與大家和好。但露茜是一個非常誠實的小姑娘，她堅信自己是對的，她不肯隨便亂說。可是別人呢，都認為她在說謊，而且是說了一個非常愚蠢的謊，這使她感到非常的委屈。彼得和蘇姍批評她說謊並不是有意奚落她，但愛德蒙卻是有點故意找茬，這次，他抓住了把柄似的不斷取笑露茜，一次又一次地問她是不是在屋內別的櫥里又發現了別的國家。那幾天本該是非常令人愉快的日子，天氣很好，他們從早到晚都在外邊，洗澡啦，釣魚啦，爬樹啦，掏鳥窩啦，躲在石楠樹叢中玩啦，但露茜對這些卻一點也不感興趣。這樣的情況一直延續到以後的又一個陰雨天。\n那一天，直到下午，雨還沒有停，一點也沒有轉晴的跡象。他們決定做捉迷藏的遊戲，其他三個人躲，由蘇珊負責「捉」。大家剛散開，露茜就走進了放衣櫥的那間空屋。她並不想躲到櫥里去，因為她知道，如果那樣做的話，就只會使旁人再次談論起那件令人難堪的事來。但她很想到櫥里去看一看，因為這些天來，她開始懷疑那尼亞和農牧之神只不過是個夢罷了。她想，房子這樣大，結構又是這樣複雜，可躲藏的地方多得很，先到櫥里看一看，再躲到旁的地方，時間總是來得及的。但她一走進衣櫥，就聽見外邊走廊里有腳步聲，她沒有別的辦法，只好跳了進去，並順手帶上了櫥門。她沒有將門關嚴，因為她知道，即使這不是一個神秘的衣櫥，一個人把自己關在衣櫥里也是非常愚蠢的。\n原來是愛德蒙跑進來了，他走進屋內，剛好看見露茜的身影消失在衣櫥中。他急忙追上去，這倒不是他把衣櫥看做是躲藏的好地方，而是因為他想繼續嘲笑她編造的那個國家的故事。他拉開櫥門，裡邊像平常一樣掛著外套，還有樟腦丸的氣味，黑糊糊，靜悄悄的，不見露茜的人影。「她以為我是蘇珊來找她的，」愛德蒙自言自語地說，「所以她一直躲在衣櫥里不吱聲。」於是，他一步跨進去，關上了門，也忘記了這樣做有多傻。他隨即在暗中摸索起來，他原以為不消幾秒鐘就能摸到她，但使他吃驚的是，他怎麼也摸不到。他想去開門，讓亮光透一點進來，可他沒能找到櫥門。他氣得四下亂摸，還高聲喊著：\n「露茜，璐！你躲在哪裡呀？還不出來，我知道，你就在這兒。」\n沒有回答，愛德蒙發現他的聲音非常奇怪，不像你所想象的在櫥里的那種聲音，而像是在曠野里發出來的。他感到冷的出奇。正在這時，他看見前面有一線亮光。\n「謝天謝地。」愛德蒙說，「一定是櫥門自己盪開了。」他已經將露茜忘的一乾二淨，只顧朝著那亮光走去，他還以為那裡就是開著的櫥門呢。但他馬上發現，他並沒有走出衣櫥返回空屋，而是從濃密的樅樹蔭里走進了林中的一片空地。\n他的腳下踩著又干又脆的雪，樹林上也堆著一簇一簇的積雪，頭頂上空是一片蔚藍的天，這就像人們在冬天晴朗的早晨看到的那種天上的顏色。太陽剛從正前方的樹榦間升起，鮮紅鮮紅的。四周一片寂靜，好像在那個國家，除了他以外，什麼生靈也不存在了。在樹林中間，連一隻知更鳥和松鼠也沒有，森林向四面八方伸展開去，一望無際。他不禁打起了寒戰。\n這時他忽然想起，他是來尋找露茜的，他也想到，他對她講的故事是多麼反感，而現在周圍的一切證明她講的情況原是真的。他想露茜一定就在附近什麼地方，所以他高聲喊叫著：「露茜！露茜！我是愛德蒙，我也來了。」\n沒有回答。\n「她是因為我最近錯怪了她而生我的氣吧。」愛德蒙想。雖然他不願意承認自己錯了，但也不想一個人孤零零地站在這個陌生、寒冷而又孤寂的地方，於是他又喊了起來：\n「喂，露茜，以前我不相信你說的話，請你原諒。現在我已明白，你說的是對的。趕快出來，我們和好吧。」\n仍然沒有回答。\n「真是女孩子氣，」愛德蒙自言自語地說，「一個勁地鬧彆扭，人家向她賠禮道歉了，她還是不睬人。」他又看了看四周，感到實在沒有必要在這裡逗留。他正要準備回家的時候，聽見遙遠的樹林里傳來了鈴兒的響聲。他仔細傾聽著。鈴聲越來越近，最後他看見，一輛雪橇由兩匹馴鹿拉著疾馳而來。\n這兩匹馴鹿和謝德蘭群島的矮種馬差不多大小，它們身上的毛比雪還要白，它們頭上的叉角在朝陽的映照下閃爍著紅光。它們脖子上的套具是用深紅色的皮革製成的，上面帶著鈴鐺。坐在雪橇上趕鹿的是個肥胖的小妖，如果他站直了的話，大約只有三英尺高。他穿著北極熊皮做的衣服，頭上圍著一條紅色的頭巾，長長的金黃色的穗子從它的頂上垂下來；他的大鬍子一直垂到兩膝，簡直可以當作一條圍巾來使用。在他後面，在雪橇中間一個高得多的座位上，坐著一個與眾不同的女人，她比愛德蒙以前見過的任何一個女人都要高大。她也全身穿著雪白的毛皮衣服，右手握著一根又長又直的金棍，頭上戴著一頂金冠。除了她那血紅的嘴以外，她的臉就像雪、紙或冰糖一樣白。她的臉孔還算漂亮，但卻顯得十分驕橫和冷酷。\n雪橇向愛德蒙疾馳而來，鈴兒「叮噹」「頂當」地響著，小妖「噼噼啪啪」地揮著鞭子，雪向雪橇的四邊飛濺，看上去真像一幅美麗的圖畫。\n「停！」坐在雪橇上的那個女人說，小妖猛地拉了一下馴鹿，馴鹿幾乎都坐了起來。它們很快恢復了原狀，立在那兒，「格格」地咬著嘴裡的嚼子，呼呼直喘氣。在這種嚴寒的天氣里，它們鼻孔里呼出來的熱氣看起來就像煙霧一般。\n「喂，你是幹什麼的？」那個女人問，兩眼緊盯著愛德蒙。\n「我，我，我的名字叫愛德蒙。」愛德蒙局促不安地說。他很不滿意她打量他時的那種神情。\n那女人皺起了雙眉，「你就這樣對女王講話嗎？」她說，樣子顯得更加嚴厲了。\n「請原諒，陛下，我不知道你是女王。」愛德蒙說。\n「不認識那尼亞的女王？」她尖聲喊道，「哈，很快你就會認得的。回我的話：你到底是幹什麼的？」\n「陛下，」愛德蒙說，「我不懂你的意思，我在上學——確實是這樣，陛下——這幾天學校放假。」"

  chinese_body: "小矮人和妖婆正在說這些話時，好幾英里之外的海狸和孩子們正在走啊走的，恍如進入一個美妙的夢境。他們早就把大衣扔下了。如今他們相互間不再說什麼「瞧，有隻翠鳥！」或「嗨，風信子！」也不再說「那股可愛的香味是什麼？」或「聽聽那隻畫眉！」他們默默走著，深深陶醉其中，從暖和的太陽地里走進陰涼、碧綠的灌木叢中、又走到寬闊、長滿苔蘚的林間空地，空地上高高的榆樹當頭搭起枝葉茂密的綠蔭，然後他們又走進密密麻麻一大片開著花的紅醋栗中，走到山楂叢中，那兒的香味幾乎能醉倒人。\n他們眼看冬天消失，整個森林在幾小時內就從一月到了五月，也跟愛德蒙一樣感到驚奇。他們甚至沒有像妖婆那樣肯定這是阿斯蘭到了納尼亞才會出現的事，但他們都知道是妖婆的咒語變出了沒完沒了的冬天；因此他們全知道這個不可思議的春天一開始，妖婆的陰謀詭計就失敗了，而且大大失敗了。融雪持續了一段時間，他們大家都明白妖婆再也不能用雪橇了。此後他們就不再匆匆忙忙趕路，也容許自己多休息幾回，休息時間更長一些。他們眼下當然很疲勞；但不是那種所謂筋疲力盡——只是沒精打采，覺得恍恍惚惚的，而且心裡很平靜，就像在戶外待了漫長一天，終於到頭時的感覺。蘇珊一隻腳後跟磨起了一個小水皰。\n他們早就離開了那條大河的河道，因為必需稍稍往右轉(就是說稍稍向南)才能到達石桌那兒。即使這條路不是他們該走的路，一旦融雪開始，他們也不能老沿著河谷走，因為有了那麼多融雪，河裡很快就發大水了——一股來勢驚人、咆哮轟鳴的黃濁洪水——他們走的小路就會淹在水裡了。\n這會兒太陽快下山了，天色更紅，影子也拉長了，花兒也開始要收攏了。\n「現在不遠了。」海狸先生說著開始帶領他們上山，穿過一段深深的、鬆軟的青苔(他們疲勞的雙腳踩在上面倒覺得很舒服)，那地方只稀稀拉拉長著一些高大的樹木。在漫長的白天結束時爬山，大家都喘不過氣來。露茜心裡正在想，不好好休息一陣子，自己能不能爬上山頂；但突然間，他們就到山頂上了。\n他們站在一片綠油油的空地上，在那兒你可以俯瞰森林，除了正前方，目光所及都是綿延不絕的森林。東邊遠處，有什麼東西閃閃發亮，還在晃動。「天哪！」彼得悄聲對蘇珊說，「大海！」山頂這塊空地的正中就是石桌。那是一塊很大的灰色石板，下面撐著四塊筆直的石頭。石桌看上去年代悠久，上面刻滿了奇怪的線條和符號，可能是一種無名語言的字母吧。你看著這些符號．一種好奇的感覺就會油然而生。他們看到的第二件東西是空地一邊搭起的一個帳篷，那是一個奇妙的帳篷——尤其是這會兒落日的餘暉正照在帳篷上——帳篷面子看上去像杏黃緞子，深紅的繩索，象牙色的帳篷樁；帳篷的支柱上，高高掛著一面綉著一隻騰躍的紅色獅子的旗子，正迎風飄揚，這陣從遠處海面吹來的微風也輕拂著他們的臉。他們正看著這帳篷，只聽見右面傳來一陣音樂，便不由向那邊轉過身去，這才看見了他們特地來看的東西。\n阿斯蘭站在一群生物中間，它們圍著它形成一個半月形。有樹精和水精(在我們的世界里稱為森林女神和水仙女)，她們都有弦樂器;音樂就是她們演奏的。有四隻巨大的人頭馬，身體像英國飼養場里的駿馬，頭部像嚴厲而俊美的巨人。還有一匹獨角獸，一匹人頭牛，一隻鵜鶘，一隻鷹和一條大狗。阿斯蘭身邊站著兩頭豹，一頭拿著它的王冠，另一頭舉著它的旗幟。\n說到阿斯蘭，海狸夫婦和孩子們都不知道看見它時該怎麼辦、怎麼說。沒有到過納尼亞的人往往認為決不會有好人讓人見了害怕的。如果孩子們以前這麼認為，眼下他們已經糾正了這種想法。因為當他們想看看阿斯蘭的臉時，只看了一眼金色的鬃毛和那雙威武、高貴、莊嚴、懾人的眼睛，他們就覺得自己不能正眼看它了，大家都不禁在發抖。\n「去吧。」海狸先生悄聲說。\n「不，」彼得悄聲說，「你先走。」\n「不，亞當的兒子走在動物前面。」海狸先生又悄悄回了他一句。\n「蘇珊，」彼得悄聲說，「你怎麼樣？女土先走嘛。」\n「不，你年齡最大。」蘇珊悄聲說。當然他們這樣拖得越長，就越感到尷尬。後來彼得才終於明白這事全靠他了。他抽出劍來，舉斂致敬，匆匆對其他幾個說：「快來吧，你們定下神來。」他向獅王走去，說道：「我們來了——阿斯蘭。」\n「歡迎，彼得，亞當的兒子，」阿斯蘭說，「歡迎，蘇珊和露茜，夏娃的女兒。歡迎，公海狸和母海狸。」\n它的聲音深沉、圓潤，不知怎麼竟消除了他們的不安。他們如今只覺得又高興又平靜，站在那兒不說話也不覺得尷尬了。\n「可是第四個在哪兒呢？」阿斯蘭問。\n「他想要出賣他們，投靠白妖婆，哦，阿斯蘭。」海狸先生說。於是彼得只好說：「這事多少得怪我，阿斯蘭。我對他發脾氣，我想那反而促使他變壞了。」\n阿斯蘭不吭聲，既沒說原諒彼得，也沒責怪他，只是站在那兒，金色的大眼睛直望著他。大夥覺得似乎沒什麼可說的了。\n「請問——阿斯蘭，」露茜說，「有什麼辦法救救愛德蒙嗎？」\n「要想盡辦法，」阿斯蘭說，「不過這事可能比你們想象的更困難。」接著它又沉默了一會。直到那一刻，露茜還始終認為它的臉看上去多麼高貴、剛毅、寧靜；如今她突然發覺它看上去也很憂傷。不過這種神情一會兒就過去了。獅王搖搖鬃毛，兩隻爪子一拍(露茜想，「要是它不知道剛中帶柔，這對爪子可嚇人呢。」)，開口說道：\n「現在準備好宴席，女士們，把夏娃的女兒帶到帳篷里去，照顧好她們。」\n女孩子走了以後，阿斯蘭伸出一隻爪子擱在彼得肩膀上——雖然動作輕柔，卻十分有力——說道，「來吧，亞當的兒子，我將指給你看你將來當國王的那座城堡的遠景。」\n彼得仍然一手握劍，跟著獅王一起來到山頂的東邊。一幅美景出現在他們眼前。太陽已經落在他們背後。他們下面的整個國土都籠罩在暮色中——森林和小山，山谷，以及像條銀蛇般蜿蜒流過的大河的下游。那邊幾英里以外是大海，大海以外是天空，落日映照下滿是玫瑰色的雲層。但就在納尼亞國土近海的地方——其實就是那條大河的入海口——有什麼東西屹立在一座小山上閃閃發光。因為這是一座城堡，朝彼得這邊的窗戶當然都映出落日的餘輝；不過彼得覺得城堡就像海岸上的一顆大星星。\n「男子漢啊，」阿斯蘭說，「那就是有四個寶座的凱爾帕拉維爾，你必須以國王的身分坐上其中一個寶座。我指給你看是因為你是老大，你要當個地位高於其他人的至尊王。」\n彼得又一次什麼也沒說，因為這時一種奇怪的聲音突然打破了這片沉默。像一隻軍號，不過聲音更圓潤。\n「這是你妹妹的號角，」阿斯蘭低聲對彼得說，如果說獅子咕嚕咕嚕叫不算大不敬的話，那麼這聲音低得簡直就是咕嚕咕嚕的。\n彼得一時不明白。後來，他看見所有的生物都擁上前來，只聽得阿斯蘭揮揮爪子說：「退下！讓王子立個頭功吧。」他才明白，於是他飛快地奔向帳篷。在那兒，他看見了一幕可怕的情景。\n水仙女和森林女神正四下奔逃。露茜臉色蒼白，撒開兩條短腿朝他跑來。接著他看見蘇珊向一棵樹衝去，縱身爬上了樹，後面有一頭灰色的巨獸在追她。開頭彼得以為那是一隻熊。後來他看出這頭野獸很像一條德國狼狗，然而又比狗大多了。後來他才想到這是一匹狼——一匹狼後腿站著，前爪撲在樹榦上又咬又吼，背上的毛根根豎起。蘇珊只攀上第二根大樹枝，再也沒法爬高。她一條腿吊在下面，這隻腳離開亂咬的狼牙只有一兩英寸。彼得不知道她為什麼不爬得高一點，至少也要抓牢些嘛；後來他才明白她快暈過去了，如果她暈過去，那就會摔下來。\n彼得並不覺得自己十分勇敢；說真的，他感到自己快要嘔吐了。不過這並不影響他的使命，他筆直衝向那頭猛獸，瞄準它肋間猛刺一劍。這一下子並沒刺中那匹狼。它閃電般轉過身來，眼睛凶焰灼人，嘴巴張得老大，狂嚎一陣。要不是它怒氣沖沖，非得嚎叫一通才痛快，它就會立刻咬住彼得的喉嚨了。事實上——儘管這一切都太快，彼得根本來不及想——他只來得及彎下身子，使盡渾身力氣，把劍刺進那猛獸前腿之間，刺中了心臟。接下來一段工夫又可怕又混亂，就像惡夢中的情景。他用力拖啊，拉啊，那匹狼既不像死了，也不像活著，露出一口利牙磕在他的額頭上，一切都沾滿了血、熱氣和皮毛。又過了一會，他才發現那頭巨獸已經倒地死去。他拔出劍，挺直腰板，擦去滿頭滿臉的開。他覺得累壞了。過了一會兒，蘇珊才從樹上下來。她見到彼得時兩人都覺得有點搖搖晃晃。不用說，雙方見了不免又是親吻又是哭泣。不過在納尼亞，沒人會為這事而把你往壞處想的。\n「快！快！」只聽得阿斯蘭的聲音在大聲喊叫，「人頭馬！雄鷹！我看見灌木叢中還有一匹狼。瞧——在你們後面！它要到它的女主人那兒去了。現在正是你們找到妖婆和救出第四個亞當的兒子的好機會。」話音剛落，頓時響起一陣雷鳴般的馬蹄聲和翅膀撲棱聲，約有十幾隻動作最迅速的動物消失在暮色中。\n彼得還沒喘過氣來，轉過身，看見阿斯蘭就在他身邊。\n「你忘了把劍擦乾淨。」阿斯蘭說。\n這話不錯，彼得看到那把光亮的劍已經被狼的毛和血弄污了，不由漲紅了臉。他彎下腰，在草地上把劍擦乾淨，再在自己衣服上把劍擦乾。\n「把劍遞給我，跪下，亞當的兒子。」阿斯蘭說。彼得遵命跪下以後，它用劍的平面拍了他一下，說道，「起來吧，彼得·芬瑞斯—貝思閣下。不管出了什麼事，永遠別忘記擦乾淨你的劍。」"

  chinese_body: "兩個女孩子還蹲在灌木叢中，雙手掩面的時候，聽見妖婆大聲叫喊：\n「好了！大家都跟著我，我們要去收拾這些殘兵敗將了！既然這個大笨蛋，這隻大貓死了，我們不久就可以打垮這些人渣和叛徒。」\n這時姐妹倆有一陣倒是非常危險了，因為只聽見陣陣野蠻的叫喊，尖銳的風笛聲、號角聲響成一片，那幫惡劣的暴徒從山頂上一哄而下，正好經過她們藏身的地方。她們只覺得幽靈像一陣陰風從身邊掠過，大地在牛頭怪賓士的蹄聲中顫抖了，頭頂上一陣猛禽撲翅的腥風，只見黑壓壓—片都是兀鷹和大蝙蝠。換了別的時候，她們早就害怕得渾身發抖了，但如今阿斯蘭一死，她們滿腦子悲哀、羞辱和恐怖，簡直沒想到害怕。\n樹林里剛剛靜下來．蘇珊和露茜就爬到空曠的山頂上。貝殼雖快落下，又有片片浮雲遮掩，但她們仍然看得出獅王五花大綁橫屍那兒的模樣。她倆跪在濕漉漉的草地上，親著它冰涼的臉，撫摸它美麗的毛——剩下來的那點毛——哭到哭不出來為止。隨後她們彼此對望著，由於感到凄涼，兩人手拉手又哭了起來，接著又一次沉默。最後露茜說：\n「我受不了那隻可怕的嘴套的樣子。不知我們能不能把嘴套拿掉？」\n於是她們就試試看。弄了好一陣子之後(因為她們的手指都冰涼，而且這時正是夜裡最黑暗的時候)，她們終於拿掉了，等她們看到它臉上沒有嘴套了．她們又大哭起來，又是親吻，又是撫摸，還儘可能把上面的鮮血和泡沫擦掉。這種凄涼、絕望、可怕的情景我真不知怎麼描寫才好。\n「不知我們能不能把它身上的繩子也解開？」不一會兒蘇珊說。但敵人出於怨恨把繩子拉得很緊很緊，兩個女孩怎麼也解不開這些結。我希望本書讀者沒人像蘇珊和露茜那天晚上那麼痛苦過；不過如果你曾經有過——如果你整夜沒睡，哭得再也哭不出眼淚——你就知道到頭來，心境就會有一種平靜。你覺得似乎再也不會出什麼事了。不管怎麼說，這兩個女孩子當時的感覺就是這樣。時間似乎就在這種麻木的平靜中過去了好幾個小時，她們簡直沒注意到自己越來越冷了。但最後露茜總算注意到兩件事情。第一點，小山東面的天空比一小時前亮了一點。第二點，她腳邊的草地上有些小小的動靜。開頭她對此毫無興趣。這又有什麼關係呢？現在什麼都無所謂了。但她終於看出這不知名的東西開始爬上石桌那四條筆直的腿了。這會兒，那些東西正在阿斯蘭身上爬來爬去呢。她湊近仔細看看，原來是些灰不溜秋的小東西。\n「嗨！」蘇珊在石桌對面說，「多討厭！爬在它身上的是些討厭的小老鼠。走開，你們這些小畜生。」她舉起手想把它們嚇跑。\n「等等！」露茜仍然在近處一直看著它們，「你看不出它們在幹什麼嗎？」\n兩個女孩子都彎下腰，目不轉睛地盯著。\n「真的，我信了！」蘇珊說，「多怪啊，它們正在咬斷繩子呢！」\n「我也這麼想，」露茜說，「我看它們是友好的老鼠。可憐的小東西——它們不知道阿斯蘭死了。它們以為把繩子解開會對它有點好處。」這會兒天亮多了，兩個女孩子這才第一次注意到彼此的臉多麼蒼白。她們看得見那些小老鼠，幾十隻幾十隻的，甚至有成百上千隻，一口口咬著，最後，那些繩子全被咬斷了。這會兒東方的天空已經發白，星星漸漸隱沒——只有地平線上還有一顆很大的星星。這時她們覺得比晚上更冷了。那些小老鼠也都爬開了。\n姐妹倆把咬斷的繩子殘屑都清除掉。沒有這些繩子，阿斯蘭就恢復了原來的模樣。天色越來越亮，她們也更看得清，它那張沒有生氣的臉看上去越來越高貴了。\n她們背後的林子里有隻鳥兒唧喳叫了一聲。因為好幾個小時以來這裡都是一片寂靜，這聲音把她們嚇了一跳。接著另一隻鳥兒應和了。不一會兒到處都是鳥兒在歌唱。\n這會兒肯定是清晨不是深夜了。\n「我真冷。」露茜說。\n「我也是，」蘇珊說，「我們走走吧。」她們走到小山的東崖邊往下看去。那顆大星星幾乎消失了。田野看上去全是深灰色一片，不過在田野外天邊的那片大海倒是一片灰白。天空開始轉紅了。她們在死去的阿斯蘭和東面山脊之間來回走了無數次，想法取暖；啊呀，她們的腿有多累啊。於是，她們站了一會兒，眺望大海和凱爾帕拉維爾(這會兒她們才看得出城堡的輪廓)，在海天相連的地平線上，紅紅的天色終於變成了金黃，太陽冉冉升起來了。就在這時，她們聽見背後一聲巨響——一聲震耳欲聾的巨響，彷彿一個巨人綳裂了鎧甲。\n「那是什麼聲音？」露茜說著一把揪住蘇珊的胳膊。\n「我——我害怕回過頭去，」蘇珊說，「出了什麼可怕的事了。」\n「它們對它下毒手啦，」露茜說，「快來吧！」她拉著蘇珊一起轉過身來。\n太陽一升起，這兒一切看上去就大不相同了——所有的色彩和陰影都變了——因此一時間她們並沒有看出那件大事。後來她們才看見，原來那張石桌在一聲巨響中從頭到尾裂成兩半；而阿斯蘭不見了。\n「哦，哦，哦！」兩個女孩子哭著奔回石桌。\n「哦，這太糟糕了，」露茜嗚咽著說，「它們該留下屍體的。」\n「這是誰幹的呢？」蘇珊叫道，「這是什麼意思？這又是魔法嗎？」\n「是的，」她們身後有一個洪亮的聲音說，「這又是魔法。」她們回頭一看。只見陽光下，站著的正是阿斯蘭，個頭比她們先前看到更大的，一面還在抖動鬃毛的(顯然鬃毛又長出來了)。\n「哦，阿斯蘭！」姐妹倆都叫了起來。她們目不轉睛地看著它，心裡又高興又害怕。\n「原來你沒死，親愛的阿斯蘭？」露茜說。\n「這會兒沒死。」阿斯蘭說。\n「你不是一個——不是一個——？」蘇珊聲音顫抖地問。她不忍心說出那個「鬼」字。\n阿斯蘭俯下金色的腦袋，舔舔她的額頭。它呼出的氣是暖烘烘的，鬃毛里似乎發出一股濃濃的香味籠罩著她。\n「我像嗎？」它說。\n「哦，你是真的，你是真的！哦，阿斯蘭！」露茜叫著，兩個女孩子都撲上前去，把它吻個遍。\n「可是這一切都是什麼意思呢？」等大家稍微平靜了一點，蘇珊問道。\n「意思是，」阿斯蘭說，「雖然妖婆懂得高深魔法，可她不懂得還有更高深一層的魔法。她懂的那一套只到遠古時代為止。但如果她能看得更遠一點，看到太古時代的寂靜和黑暗深處，她就會看到還有一條不同的咒語。她就會知道一個自願送死的犧牲者，本身沒有背叛行為，卻被當作一個叛徒而殺害，石桌就要崩裂，死亡就會起反作用。而現在——」\n「哦，是啊，現在呢？」露茜跳起來拍著手說。\n「哦，孩子們，」獅王說，「我覺得自己的力量又恢復了。哦，孩子們，看看你們能抓住我嗎？」它站了一會兒沒動，眼睛閃閃發亮，四肢抖個不停，尾巴用力甩啊甩的。接著它一躍而起，跳過她們頭頂，落在石桌對面。露茜哈哈大笑，雖然她自己也不知道為什麼笑；她趕緊爬過石桌去抓他。阿斯蘭又是一跳。一場瘋狂的追逐就此開始。它帶領她們在山頂上轉啊轉啊，一會兒讓她們夠也夠不著，一會兒讓她們差點抓到它的尾巴，一會兒從她們中間衝過去，一會兒用它美麗而柔軟的大爪子把她們拋向半空又接住，一會兒又冷不防停下來，弄得三個嘻嘻哈哈滾成一團，只看見一堆皮毛啊、胳膊啊、腿啊什麼的。這場嬉鬧除了在納尼亞，可沒人玩過；而且露茜怎麼也拿不準，她們究竟是在跟雷雨玩呢，還是在跟小貓玩。有趣的是等他們三個最後一起躺在太陽下喘氣的時候，兩個女孩子卻再也不感到疲勞、飢餓和口渴了。\n「好了，」阿斯蘭不一會兒就說，「干正經事吧。我覺得我要吼了，你們最好把耳朵堵上。」\n她們照辦了。阿斯蘭站起來，等它張開嘴怒吼時，它的臉變得那麼可怕，她們都不敢正眼看它了。而且她們還看見它面前的樹隨著吼聲全部彎下了腰，草也隨風彎曲成了一片草場。隨後它說：\n「我們要走的路長著呢，你們一定得騎在我身上。」於是它趴下了，姐妹倆就爬到它溫暖的金色的背上，蘇珊坐在前面，緊緊抓住它的鬃毛，露茜坐在後面，緊緊抓住蘇珊。它猛一挺身，站起來就飛奔而去，比任何駿馬都快，下了小山，進入密林。\n這次騎獅也許是她們到納尼亞以來最美妙的事了。你曾經騎馬賓士過嗎？想想吧，然後去掉沉重的馬蹄得得聲和鞍具的丁當聲，只想著那四隻大爪子，著地幾乎無聲無息。再想想黑的、灰的或栗色的馬背換成了柔軟的金黃色皮毛，鬃毛在風中飛舞。再想想，你比跑得最快的賽馬還要快兩倍。而且這次騎行既不需要帶路的，也決不會疲勞。阿斯蘭往前沖啊沖的，從不失足，從不猶豫，它熟練地在樹榦之間穿過，跳過灌木叢，跳過荊棘叢，跳過小溪，路過小河，游過大河。而且你不是在路上騎行，也不是在公園裡，甚至也不是在草原上，而是橫穿整個納尼亞，在春天裡，走過條條幽暗的山毛櫸林陰路，穿過橡樹林間塊塊向陽的空地，穿過片片有雪白櫻樹的野生果園，路過水聲轟鳴的瀑布、青苔覆蓋的岩石、回聲不絕的山洞，爬上金雀花叢映照的多風的山坡，穿過有茂密石南的山肩，沿著令人眩暈的山脊，跑下去，跑下去，又一次跑進開闊的山谷，跑進大片的蘭花地。\n快到中午的時候，他們發現自己正在一片陡峭的山坡上，俯看一座城堡——從他們站的地方望去就像一個小小的玩具城堡——看上去似乎全是尖尖的塔樓。不過獅王正全速沖向城堡，因此城堡也就越來越大，她們還來不及問自己這是哪兒，就已迎面來到城堡前。此刻已不再像玩具城堡，而是陰森森地聳立在她們面前了。城垛上看不見人影，城堡大門也緊緊閉著。阿斯蘭卻一點沒有放慢步子，像一顆子彈似的，筆直朝城堡衝去。\n「妖婆的老窩到了！」它叫道，「好了，孩子們，抓緊啊！」\n一眨眼，天翻地覆，姐妹倆只覺得五臟六腑都翻了出來，因為獅王振作精神，又跳了一大跳，這一次比它以往任何一次都跳得更高——不妨說它不是跳，而是一直飛過了城堡的牆頭。兩個女孩子氣都喘不過來，但絲毫沒受傷，不知不覺中已從獅背上滾了下來，落在一個寬闊的石頭院子里，裡面全是石像。"

  chinese_body: "妖婆剛走，阿斯蘭就說，「我們得馬上離開這個地方，這兒要派別的用場。我們今晚得到貝魯那淺灘去安營。」\n大家當然都很想問問它，它是怎麼跟妖婆商定這件事的，但阿斯蘭面如鐵板，而且大家耳邊依然回蕩著它的怒吼聲，因此誰也不敢開口。\n在山頂露天下吃了一頓飯後(因為陽光這會兒已經很強，把草地都晒乾了)，他們忙了一陣子，拆掉帳篷，收拾東西。不到兩點，他們就開始行程，向西北方向出發，大家從從容容地走著，因為要去的地方並不很遠。\n旅途中開頭一段時間，阿斯蘭向彼得說明它的作戰計劃。「妖婆一旦完成她在這一帶的活動，」它說，「她同那一夥幾乎肯定要退回她的老窩準備一次圍攻。你有可能切斷她的路．不讓她回到老窩，也有可能切不斷。」隨後它繼續提出兩種作戰方案——一種是跟妖婆及其一夥在樹林里作戰，另一種是襲擊她的城堡。在這段時間裡它一直指點彼得怎麼指揮戰鬥，說什麼，「你必須把你的人頭馬布置在某某地方」，或者說「你必須派偵察員去看好她，不要讓她怎麼怎麼的」，彼得最後問：\n「但你自己不也在場嗎，阿斯蘭？」\n「那我可不能保證。」獅王回答說，同時它繼續給彼得指示。到了旅途的最後一個階段，蘇珊和露茜看阿斯蘭的時間最多。它不大說話，而且她們似乎覺得它有點憂傷。\n天還沒黑，他們到了一個地方，這兒河谷豁然開闊，河面又寬又淺。這就是貝魯那淺灘，阿斯蘭下令大家停在水的這一邊。但彼得說：\n「把營地駐紮在那一邊豈不更好——因為就怕她會來一次夜間偷襲什麼的。」\n阿斯蘭似乎正在想著另外的事情，只見它那身漂亮的鬃毛一抖，這才回過神來，說道，「啊，什麼？」彼得又說了一遍。\n「不會。」阿斯蘭聲音低沉地說，似乎這事沒什麼關係。\n「不會，她今夜不會發動進攻的。」接著它深深嘆了口氣。但一會兒它又加了一句，「想得周到還是好的，軍人就應該這樣考慮。不過這其實沒什麼關係。」於是他們就著手搭帳篷了。\n那天傍晚，阿斯蘭的情緒影響了大家。彼得想到要由他來打這一仗，心裡覺得很不安，阿斯蘭可能不在場的消息對他是一大打擊。那天晚上一頓飯大家吃得鴉雀無聲。大家都覺得這天晚上跟昨天晚上甚至當天早上大不一樣。彷彿好時光剛剛開頭，卻已經快結束了。\n這種感覺對蘇珊也大有影響，她上床后一直睡不著。她躺在那兒數數，又不停地翻來覆去，後來只聽見露茜長嘆一聲，在暗中翻到她身邊。\n「你也睡不著嗎？」蘇珊問。\n「是啊，」露茜說，「我還以為你睡著了呢。我說，蘇珊！」\n「什麼事？」\n「我有一個最可怕的預感——好像有什麼大事要臨頭了呢。」\n「是嗎？因為，事實上，我也有這種感覺。」\n「事情跟阿斯蘭有關，」露茜說，「不是它要出什麼可怕的事，就是它要幹什麼可怕的事。」\n「整個下午它都不大對勁，」蘇珊說，「露茜！它說打仗時不跟我們在一起是什麼意思？你看它今晚不會離開我們，偷偷溜走吧？」\n「它現在在哪兒？」露茜說，「它在這兒帳篷里嗎？」\n「不見得。」\n「蘇珊，讓我們出去，到處看看。也許看得見它。」\n「好，走吧，」蘇茜說，「醒著躺在這兒還不如出去看看呢。」\n兩個女孩悄沒聲兒，在其他睡著的人中摸索出一條路，偷偷出了帳篷。月光皎潔，除了河水潺潺流過石頭的聲音，一切都十分寂靜。這時蘇珊突然抓住露茜的胳膊說，「瞧！」她們看見營地的那一邊，就在樹林邊上，獅王正慢慢離開大家，走進樹林里去。她倆一句話也沒說，就跟著它走去。\n它領著她們爬上河谷的陡坡，然後稍微向左走去——顯然這是當天下午她們從石桌山下來時走的路線。它領著她們走啊走啊，走進黑咕隆咚的陰影里，又走到蒼白的月光下，走得她們的腳都被濃密的露水弄濕了。不知怎麼的，它看上去和她們認識的阿斯蘭不一樣了。它的尾巴和腦袋都搭拉下來，慢吞吞地走著，彷彿它非常、非常累了。後來，她們在穿過一片開闊的空地時，那兒沒什麼陰影讓她們躲蔽，它停下了，四面張望著。這時再逃走可就不好了，因此她們就朝它走去。她們走近時它說：\n「哦，孩子們，孩子們，你們幹嗎跟著我呀？」\n「我們睡不著。」露茜說。她深信自己不用多說，她們一直在想什麼，阿斯蘭全都知道。\n「我們跟你一起去好嗎——不論你上哪兒？」蘇珊說。\n「這個嘛——」阿斯蘭說，它似乎在考慮；後來它說，「今晚我很高興有人陪伴。好吧，如果你們答應我叫你們停下就停下，然後讓我一個人去，那你們就可以跟我來。」\n「哦，謝謝你，謝謝你，我們答應。」兩個女孩子說。\n他們又往前走了，兩個女孩子分別走在獅王兩側。可是它走得多慢哪！它那莊嚴、高貴的腦袋低垂著，鼻子都快挨到草地了。不久它一個跟蹌，發出一聲低低的呻吟。\n「阿斯蘭！親愛的阿斯蘭！」露茜說，「怎麼了？你能告訴我們嗎？」\n「你病了嗎，親愛的阿斯蘭？」蘇珊問道。\n「沒有，」阿斯蘭說，「我感到悲傷和孤獨。你們把手擱在我的鬃毛上，好讓我感覺到你們在這兒，我們就這樣走吧。」\n於是兩個女孩子照它的話做了。這可是從她們第一次看到它就想做而不經他許可永遠也不敢做的事呀——她們真的把冰涼的手伸進它那一大片美麗的鬃毛里，撫摩著它，一面跟它一起走著。不一會兒她們就看出她們跟著它已經爬上了石桌山的山坡。她們爬到樹林邊緣那兒，等她們走到最後一棵樹旁(就是周圍還有幾叢灌木的那棵)，阿斯蘭就停下說：\n「哦，孩子們，孩子們，你們得在這兒停下了。不論發生什麼事，可別讓人家看見你們。永別了。」\n於是兩個女孩子都放聲痛哭(雖然她們自己也不知道為什麼要哭)，她們摟著獅王，親親它的鬃毛，它的鼻子，它的爪子，以及它那莊重、悲哀的眼睛。這時它才轉過身去，走向山頂。露茜和蘇珊蹲在灌木叢中目送著它，以下就是她們看到的情景。\n石桌周圍站著好大一堆人，儘管是在月光下，仍然有好多人手裡拿著火把，火把燃燒時吐出一團邪氣的紅焰和黑煙。可那是些什麼人啊！長著怪牙的吃人惡魔、豺狼、牛頭怪、惡樹精和毒樹精；其他動物我就不一一描寫了，因為如果我再描寫下去，大人可能就不讓你們看這本書了——其中有冷麵怪、母夜叉、惡夢魔鬼、陰魂、恐怖魔鬼、小妖精、大頭鬼和小頭鬼等等。事實上凡是站在妖婆這一邊、聽到狼傳下妖婆命令的都來了。站在中間，靠著石桌的就是妖婆本人。\n這些畜生起先看見偉大的獅王向它們走去時，都發出一陣陣驚慌的嚎叫，就連妖婆自己一時也害怕起來。隨後她就鎮定了，發出一陣粗野的狂笑。\n「那笨蛋！」她叫道，「那笨蛋來了。把它緊緊捆上！」露茜和蘇珊連大氣也不敢出，只等阿斯蘭一聲怒吼，向它的敵人撲去。可是它竟沒吼。四個母夜叉齜牙咧嘴，斜眼看著阿斯蘭，她們走近它身邊時，開頭也猶豫不前，對要做的事有點害怕。「我說，把它捆上！」白妖婆又說了一遍。四個母夜叉向它衝去，當她們發現它毫不抵抗時，才發出勝利的尖叫。隨後兇惡的小矮人和猿猴們都一擁而上，前來幫助她們，它們把體形龐大的獅王掀翻在地，把它四個爪子綁在一起，叫喊歡呼，彷彿它們做了什麼勇敢的事，雖然只要獅王願意，一隻爪子就可以要了它們大家的命；但它卻一聲不吭，甚至敵人又拉又拖，繩子拉得那麼緊，都勒進肉里去了，它也不吭聲。接著它們開始把它拖向石桌。\n「停下，」妖婆說，「先把它的毛剃了！」\n一個吃人惡魔拿著一把大剪刀走上前來，蹲在阿斯蘭腦袋旁邊，妖婆的爪牙們發出一陣惡毒的狂笑。大剪刀喀嚓喀嚓，一堆堆鬈曲的金色鬃毛紛紛掉在地上。剪完后吃人惡魔退後一步站著，兩個女孩子從她們隱蔽的地方看得見阿斯蘭的臉沒有了鬃毛顯得那麼小，那麼異樣。敵人也看到了這一差別。\n「咦，到頭來，只不過是一隻大貓啊！」一個爪牙叫道。\n「我們過去怕的就是那東西嗎？」另一個爪牙說。它們全都擁向阿斯蘭身邊嘲笑它。說什麼「咪咪，咪咪，可憐的貓咪」，還有「你今天抓了幾隻老鼠，貓兒？」又說「你要一碟牛奶嗎，小貓咪？」\n「哦，它們怎麼能這樣？」露茜說道．臉蛋上淚珠滾滾而下。「畜生！畜生！」因為此刻一開頭感到的震驚過去了，她覺得阿斯蘭剪掉毛的臉看上去比以前顯得更勇敢、更美麗、更堅忍。\n「把它的嘴套上！」妖婆說。即使現在，它們在給它套嘴套的時候，它只要張嘴一咬，就會咬掉它們兩三隻手。但它一動也不動。這群烏合之眾似乎紅了眼，如今大伙兒都來欺侮它了。那些連它被綁起來以後仍然怕靠近它的，竟也鼓起勇氣來。過了片刻，兩個女孩子連看也看不見它了——它被整群動物密密麻麻地包圍著，大家踢它，打它，向它吐唾沫，嘲笑它。\n最後這伙暴徒鬧夠了。大家開始把五花大綁、戴著嘴套的獅王拖向石桌，推的推，拉的拉。阿斯蘭那麼魁梧，即使它們把它拖到石桌邊，也得用盡全部力氣才能把它拾到石桌面上。後來它又被緊緊捆上了很多道繩子。\n「膽小鬼！膽小鬼！」蘇珊嗚咽著說，「事到如今，它們還在害怕它嗎？」\n等到阿斯蘭被捆在那塊平坦的石頭上(而且捆得簡直成了一大堆繩子)，這群暴徒才靜了下來。四個母夜叉拿著四支火把，站在石桌四角。妖婆捋起袖子，就跟前一個晚上她對付愛德蒙時一樣。接著她磨刀霍霍。在兩個女孩子看來，那刀給火把光一照，似乎不是鋼刀而是石刀，而且形狀又古怪又可惡。\n最後她走近了。她站在阿斯蘭頭邊。她激動得臉也抽搐扭曲起來，但它卻仰著臉望著天空，仍然很平靜，既不生氣．也不害怕，只有一點憂傷。這時，就在她要砍下去的時候，她彎下腰，用顫抖的聲音說：\n「現在，是誰贏了？笨蛋！你以為這樣一來就救了那個人類的叛徒嗎？按照我們的條約，現在我要把你殺了來代替它，這一來高深魔法才會應驗。但等你死了，誰還能阻止我把他也殺了呢？而且到了那時，誰又來從我手裡把他救出去呢？你要明白，你已經把納尼亞永遠給我了，你送了自己的命，還沒救出他。知道了這一點也太晚了，沒指望了，死吧！」\n姐妹倆沒看到殺頭的那一時刻。她們不忍心看，都蒙住了自己的眼睛。"
